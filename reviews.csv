We probably stay in hotels at least 20 nights a year for a variety of reasons.  In general the staff was very courteous and friendly, but one staff member in particular went out of her way for us.\n\nOn this particular trip in July of this year (2018), I realized a few days after getting home that I was missing a small jewelry box that I use to carry some extra jewelry items when I travel, was missing.  I spoke to Arianna in housekeeping about it.  She was very helpful, taking full descriptions of the box and contents, possible locations it could have fallen in the room, etc.  She stated she would call me back the next day, as there was someone else in the room as a customer at the time, but they would check as soon as they checked out.\n\nShe called the very next day, very disappointed she had not been able to find my jewelry box, stating how they had pulled out furniture and cushions, etc.  I had to interrupt her to tell her I had found the box (it had fallen out into a crack in the car), which she was very happy to hear.  \n\nThis may sound like a small thing, but in my many years of travel, I have misplaced an item a few times and called the hotel to check and received very casual, un-caring service.  I have just been told \""We don't have it\"".  No \""sorry,\""  Or \""we will double check for it.\""  Arianna was very empathic and helpful.  She went out of her way to look for my items and call me back and she clearly cared.  That is great customer service.\n\nThank you!",5,positive

I arrived at 9:05 to see several people grabbing breakfast through the glass doors, however I was unable to get in.  Finally somebody allowed me in so I could grab a bite.  There were full bins of bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, etc that were going to waste because the doors were locked to any new comers at 9:05.  I did let several people in as I grabbed some eggs, but the idea of locking paying guests out at 9:05 from breakfast when there was plenty of food in all the serving pots felt very JV.  \nThe final thing that bothered me was that they have a happy hour near the lobby which was nice and had free drinks.  My problem is that the bathroom for happy hour patrons tucked a few twists and turns behind the happy hour area felt like a roadside rest.  It was very cold that night and the faucets to wash your hands are the automatic kind that you get at the target center or a road side rest with NO option to get hot water.

I was in an accessible room (unnecessarily), which was as big as a dorm room. The shower did not have a slope or a step-in so the room flooded when I showered. There is also no soap dish or shelf in the shower. Although the room has three mirrors, the lighting was all indirect and completely useless for makeup application.

The lay out is a little different, but it still has separate rooms for you to sit in if you want to watch tv or sit at a table, on the couch while someone else is sleeping or in the shower.\n\nThe beds were queen size, so a little better than the Homewood where we had only double beds as options. \n\nIt was very easy to access everything in the city via the walkways. We did not have to go outside much to get to where we were going. You can walk to the Target Center easily from here.  There is limited and expensive parking with the hotel. I think you could self park here when the weather is a little nicer and you aren't in need of immediate shelter.  The staff were great and very helpful.  Romeo is the bar tender for the reception time. He is very friendly. He is dealing with a lot of people all wanting alcohol at once and does a great job of getting to everyone more pleasantly than they may be with him.  Great guy!!\n\nThe people servicing the rooms were very helpful and polite.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay downtown.  \nThe place is covered up with people so the morning breakfast is rather crazy. However, if you aren't needing an omelet, you can easily get to what you need quickly.  I did have an omelet and it was worth the wait.\n\ni would rate this as a 4.5 since I my stay was as good if not better than I expected.\nA save 5s for places with a view of the ocean, lake or mountain and a spa.  This place was very good and would be a great place for anyone traveling to Minneapolis for events like baseball or basketball games.\nI enjoyed our stay.",4,positive

This Hotel has very nice and clean rooms and excellent hallways and interior.  The breakfast is also standard Embassy Suites.  If just rating on interior, rooms, and breakfast this would be a 5.  \n\nUnfortunately there were plenty of issues with our stay as well.  We arrived at almost 2pm.  There were signs on the sidewalk that valet parking was $45.  That was not a problem and I was prepared to pay for that.  The issue is that there was no parking left in front of the hotel and I was not going to double park on a busy downtown street.  We went about 1\u002F2 a block and saw signs for public parking and took that.  It was not connected to our hotel so we grabbed our luggage and walked outside to the hotel.  Strike 1.  \n\nTried checking in and this is the first time that since being a Diamond member I have not been able to check in early.  Not a big deal since I was a little early and would rather get my room than a downgrade.  We dropped our bags at the desk and went for lunch.  We will call that like Strike 1.5\n\nGot the call around 3pm that our room was ready.  Went back to check in and was given keys to our room on the 10th floor.  The hallways were stunning with the vaulted ceilings.  The room also was better than expected.  My wife asked where my water and snacks were.  I said maybe they are in the room as I have been at some properties that furnish those in the rooms for diamond members so they don't have to worry about those at the desk.  There was nothing in the room.  So having to wait to check in, no mention or thank you for diamond member, and none of my member benefits equals strike 2.\n\nWe stayed in the room until 5:20pm and then decided to head down for the evening reception which was in the bar on the 1st floor.  The location is just not big enough to hold all of the people that were in the hotel.  Waited a good 10-15 minutes for a drink.  Was also going to stop at the front desk to inquire about my diamond perks, but there were at least 30 people waiting in line when we came down at 5:20pm and when we left at 6:15pm.  I have no idea why they only have 2 people working.  We left the manager's reception early because there just was no room and the line for drinks was too long.  Strike 3.\n\nAfter we arrived back for the night, I did stop at the front desk then.  I asked for my diamond perks.  He gave me a look like you must be trying to get extra and should have already got it.  I said I didn't get anything when I checked in.  He asked for my room number and name which I gave to him and he gave me a bag with 2 waters and a bag of snack mix.  Not quite the 3 snack\u002Frefreshment items and 2 bottles of water.\n\nBreakfast in the morning was the usual Embassy Suites breakfast on the 2nd floor.  This is really the room that they should use for the evening manager's reception to accomodate all of the hotel guests.  We packed and left.  One final issue was of course hitting check-out on the Hilton app did nothing and returned an error.\n\nThere are plenty of other Hilton options in downtown Minneapolis.  This on is always the highest priced and not worth the extra money.  The Hilton is not to far and was very nice the last time I stayed there.  Even the new Hampton Inn is better in my opinion than this.",2,negative

The hotel is located just a 5 minute walk from the light rail (only $2.25 and 30 minutes from the airport). The hotel was a former office building built in the art deco style (reminiscent of the Empire State Building). \n\nI arrived at midnight and the lobby was thumping with music from the downstairs bar. The lobby pulsates with pink light and was quite loud and difficult to communicate. During the day it is still pink and this really loud music played. \n\nMy room was a King room on the 8th floor. No view to speak of. The room itself was a good size with a self-service (expensive) bar in the center of the room. Bed was very comfortable. Alarm clock next to bed had all different plugs for various phones and an iphone speaker. Bathroom was spacious with a large shower. Amenities are Bliss products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, face wash, body wash). Good water pressure.\n\nWifi was speedy, but normally $12.95.

I completed mobile checkin through the SPG app but this hotel doesn't support that. We were given a cool corner room that was pretty small with dated carpets and towels with a hole in it. House cleaning was awful, they barely touched anything in the room. We called and asked how we can get our platinum breakfast, they said you can order in room and then we got a large bill for this. We ate at Manny's breakfast one day but we got a bill item for food we didn't consume.

You're not going to like it. If you're young (or young at heart), then read on, you may enjoy this place.\n\nPersonally, I had never been to Minneapolis, but from what I had read previously (and what I found in reality), is that this just isn't a party city. I came here for memorial day weekend, and was looking to let loose a bit, so I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel had plenty in the way of music\u002Fa nice bar\u002Fclub atmosphere. I was surprised at how expensive drinks were, but then again I was also surprised at how expensive the city in general was (restaurants, bars, Uber rides, etc.). I definitely thought it would be a lot cheaper than San Francisco, but it was only marginally so. \n\nService at the hotel was great. Everyone at the reception was very friendly, attentive and helpful with any needs we had. Room service was prompt and the food tasted great (albeit expensive, but hey, it's a hotel so that's to be expected). I feel like it would behoove the hotel to tell their bouncers to be a little bit more deferential to actual guests staying at the hotel (as in, some sort of priority line to enter the \""Lobby Room\u002FClub area\"" sort of thing), but whatever, it's not that big a deal. Did have a bit of a billing issue but it was promptly resolved by accounting after a couple of e-mails back and forth - again, not a major issue. \n\nThe actual building that the hotel is situated it is in pretty cool - built in 1927 before the Great Depression; the whole place just feels historic, and the room we stayed in - the \""Cool Corner\"" had beautiful views of downtown Minneapolis and the surrounding outdoors. \n\nAll in all, it was a great stay. I can't really give it a full 5 star review however, just because for the price, it really doesn't come close to other W properties, namely somewhere like the W in Bangkok - but again, that's not to fault the staff. It's just not really fair to compare a property that was built brand new from the ground up (Bangkok) with one that's housed in a remodeled building, in what is admittedly far less of an exotic and outlandish town (Minneapolis, while pretty - let's be real - just isn't the most exciting city on Earth).

The atmosphere is art deco\u002Fswanky - pretty cool and a nice change from the typical hotel. Our room was a corner room on the 13th floor and the view was nice of some of downtown Minneapolis. But, upon closer inspection, we saw the room was pretty dirty. It's obvious the cleaning staff probably doesn't actually use any corner attachments when vacuuming, as the corners (ESPECIALLY under the bed) are dusty\u002Fdirty. One bathrobe had a disgusting stain, the chair cushion has probably never been lifted and cleaned underneath, there were spots on the wall and headboard, and the bed side stereo had a big stain on the speaker. There was broken glass between bed table and wall, the corkscrew was filthy and literally broke in my husband's hands (before he could even use it - but a replacement was sent to our room), and the toilet paper was very scratchy 1-ply. Probably the worst tp I've ever used in any hotel. The website boasts of a walk-in rainforest shower. It is walk-in and good size, but the 'rainforest' part was a little disappointing. It was a single shower head - not even a large one- hanging from the ceiling. \nThings we enjoyed: overall ambience of the hotel, the views, close proximity of restaurants and some shopping, the observation deck and small museum, pleasant staff, comfortable bed and pillows, and the valet parking. \nOverall, we really did enjoy our stay and the location. I just wish the rooms were a little better maintained as some of the furniture was a bit banged up, and, like previously stated above, our room was not fully clean.

Skyway access is closeby, but I dodged a bullet where it was 50 degrees Fahrenheit on a Saturday in March.\n\nFrom check-in to check-out, the service at the W met the high standard set by other hotels in the brand.\n\nI stayed in room 1101, in the corner with a view to the south. The room was what you would expect from a W hotel - neat decor and a comfortable bed. I particularly liked the shower - extra tall and roomy.\n\nThere are a couple bars on the property - the standard W living room, and a bar called Prohibition on the 27th floor. Prohibition was lively on a Saturday. Adjacent to the hotel (and accessible from the lobby) is the Keys Cafe, a diner sort of situation with tasty, filling breakfast.\n\nThe only strange thing about the hotel was the Wi-Fi. Usually at other Starwood properties, Wi-Fi is complementary to SPG members. I'm SPG Gold and the login screen stated that Wi-Fi was complimentary for SPG Platinum only, and a day of access would be ~$14 and change.

Old and historic building that is modern in the most W way possible (this is a good thing). I walk by the \""Living Room\"" on the right which can only be described as the coolest hotel bar\u002Flounge I may have ever seen. Indoor firepits and plush velvet couches everywhere, and of course a DJ in the corner spinning records. Or I guess it's spinning \""laptop\"" these days. I walk into the check-in area and everything is pink (due to pink lighting - see picture). The gal at check in is friendly and we chat about good restaurants in the area. No mention of my Titanium Marriot status and subsequently no room upgrade. I ask if the hotel is full and she says \""no, it's kinda slow this week\"". I'm not an upgrade begger so I go back to talking about dinner. I request a high floor and they put me on 19 (32 floor hotel). \""High enough\"" I think to myself as I walk to the beautifully accented elevators.\n\nI booked a \""cool corner room\"", to have a variety of views and presumably a little more space (I book this room at the W in Seattle and am always happy with it). I walk in my room and while it is on the corner, it is TINY for a corner room and small for any room. Not cruise ship small but Tokyo small for sure. And the decor is original W style (purple carpet, round mini bar, all black bathroom, etc). While the room was a bit tired (both in style and condition), it was extremely clean, no issues there. The bed was just \""ok\"", but certainly not plush like at the JW in St. Paul where I was the night before. Also, the view in both directions of my corner room was directly into two different office skyscrapers. Not the hotels fault but don't necessarily expect a skyline like in other cities. \n\nThe location of the hotel seemed great for being downtown. 1 block to Zelo (great modern Italian restaurant) and the Foshay building the hotel is in is connected to the downtown skyway (pedestrian bridge that comes in handy when it's snowing, cold and miserable out).\n\nSO - the service at this hotel wasn't great, and the room was just \""ok\"". But the building, common areas and location were outstanding and probably enough for me to return at some point but I'll likely try other properties for my now monthly trip to Minneapolis.

I am a Marriott rewards member but have not stayed at an AC hotel before. We were both pleasantly surprised at the condition and accommodations, only because it is in a less-than-desirable area of DT Minneapolis, but it worked for us because it was close to a venue that we were attending. Check-in, with the app and the front desk, was quick. The room was beautiful, with a nice big walk-in shower, modern and comfortable furniture and a clean hotel overall. For a Friday night, we didn't have any problem securing a parking spot in the ramp, but not crazy about the fact that it was $28 charge per night. The hotel itself was quiet and had a relaxing atmosphere. My only other disappointment was that breakfast was not included but glad there was a marketplace available onsite.

I've had several conversations with management about these issues, but they seem to be getting worse. \n\nThe last straw for me was an event that occurred during my last visit.\n\nI'm curious to know why the housekeeping staff feel comfortable entering rooms that have a \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign on them.\n\nOn my last visit, I was offered late check out (4 pm), which I accepted. On the last day of the visit, I was sitting in the room reading when I heard the door open (no knock). I gasped and dropped my book and whomever was at the door immediately slammed it shut.\n\nI immediately ran to the door and opened it to catch the would-be intruder outside. After a few seconds, this African woman peeks around the corner mumbling apologies. \nI asked her who she was. \nShe said she was with housekeeping. \nI asked her if she saw the \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign on the door. \nShe said she did, but that she was there to clean the room.\n I told her that I had late check out, and that I had already informed the other maid (who came knocking around 11 am although check out is at noon) that I had late check out. \nShe said something about it not being noted on her assignment sheet. \n\nAt this point, I no longer felt safe in my room and I decided to check-out, but not before reporting the incident to management. \n\nAs I made my way to the front desk though, I had a disconcerting realization. \n\nThis woman claimed to be with housekeeping, but there was no cleaning cart anywhere in the hallway. Not a even a vacuum or a mop. What kind of cleaning was she going to do with no supplies?\n\nI firmly believe that this woman came into my room with the intention to steal from me. I believe that she expected the room to be empty so that she could sift through my belongings and take what she wanted. I cannot conceive another logical explanation for why a maid would enter a guest's room without knocking (and with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door!) without cleaning supplies and with no cleaning cart in sight.\n\nIf you stay at this hotel, please make sure you use both of the locks on your door when you are in your room. Also, make use of the in-room safes when you are staying here because some of the housekeeping practices here are dubious at best, and some of the housekeeping staff cannot be trusted.

Small fridge provided and stocked with bottled water each day but there was no dresser or drawers (remember European style) so we lived out of suitcases for 3 days.  Minor inconvenience.   Shower offered both wand and ceiling based rain shower options.   Again, surprising and nice touch.  The breakfast is $16 for a European buffet which was delicious the one day we tried it.

I wish some other reviewer had shared the following information. I booked the atrium junior suite. The room was well sized, but I did not realize there was no coffee maker., also there is no icemaker access so if you want ice you have to call and order it and then are sorta obligated to tip for what should be included.  the very small refrigerator is stocked with overpriced priced local liquor..I also did not realize the atrium suite  was just that , no view. Looks out over an atrium and at night you see into the room if you forget to shut the blinds. We went for a drink to check out the pool area and the only wine by the glass is canned and not local. But all the beer is local only, no bud...but to order actual Chardonnay you need to order a split, 350 ml and it\u2019s $20, so one round , one beer and one wine was $30 before tip...to go to pool area you need your key and it\u2019s separate from the bar area so you walk through the sauna area to get to pool...we brought our overpriced drinks to pool with us and we were told we were supposed to have plastic cups..made me feel like a delinquent...but that\u2019s not the worst part, they sell passes to the public for the afternoon so we arrived to a very packed pool (more like a large hot tub) crowded area with drunks.

The server did not know what annisette was or grappa...and none of them were offfered.

data/ca/43323/10812456/687935897.html,Hewing Hotel,"""This two-and-a-half-year-old Minneapolis boutique hotel is a charmer. A former mill, the hotel lobby, restaurant and rooms utilize plenty of wood and brick to create an atmosphere that oozes warmth and a cool vibe. You feel good from the moment you walk in. We did, anyway. We got in late and thanks to a welcoming bartender managed to sneak in a meal seconds before the kitchen closed Sunday night. The resulting club sandwich had all the flavor promised on the menu, maybe more, and they whipped up a salad that wasn't on the menu. The bartender also provided some local history and answered questions about the area. Way cool as we enjoyed our nightcap. Breakfast in the hotel was delish, but you might be best served grabbing a roll or granola for much less from one of the nearby coffee shops. The gratis coffee in the lobby was perfect. All that said, the breakfast in the restaurant hit the spot. The women at the desk this Monday morning were also helpful and radiated personality to match the hotel. They recommended we take a couple of the hotel's bicycles for a spin along the river (we would've gone to the nearby lakes if we'd had more time). Great recommendation. Kudos to both. The only downside to our one-night stay - and it was a big downside and so I write this as a cautionary note to others - is a $46 per night valet charge. This is steep, more than in most larger cities. Since we arrived late at night and were unfamiliar with the area, we didn't have time to investigate options. Nor did we want to.

data/ca/43323/10812456/691553350.html,Hewing Hotel,"""Although this is a three-star review, I do think this is a very nice property; I just don't know that it was worth the cost.   First, this is a very trendy, sleek, boutique hotel with a lot of rough cut wood and exposed pipes and duct work.  Their clientele seems to be mostly the under-35 crowd.  We counted no less than four bachelorette parties in less than an hour on a recent Saturday evening, and, returning to the hotel one night around 11:00 on Friday, we found the lobby\u002Fbar to be standing-room only with good-looking twenty-somethings.  No doubt, a popular place to see and be seen.  \n\nWe were in town for a wedding with our 16-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter and knew they had a rooftop pool and also a rooftop bar\u002Fsauna\u002Fsocial club that is open to the public.  What we didn't understand from TA and the Hewing website was that all of those areas (including the pool) are 21-and-over only.  It is spelled out and now that we know the layout we see it was our misunderstanding but prior, we didn't understand that the social club and age restriction included the pool.  Kids were disappointed.  \n\nOur room was $230 a night which isn't outlandish but we were surprised to find out that the only parking available is through the valet at $46 a day.  That is Michigan Avenue-Chicago expensive; not what I expected in Minneapolis.  Again, the price was probably indicated somewhere but maybe we didn't dig enough in advance.  We asked if there were other parking options around and, similar to the experience of another reviewer, the front desk staff didn't seem to know.  One young lady said there was a garage over closer to Target Field but didn't know the cost.  We found there was a small lot just next to the hotel but weren't aware if overnight parking was allowed.  There were also garages nearby which the valets used. With parking and taxes our bill for our stay was just about $300 a night.  \n\nRooms were fine -- neat and comfortable but nothing special. Clothes rack instead of closets.  No usable refrigerator; just the one for mini-bar items.  No ice available without calling the desk.  And we were surprised to find that housekeeping doesn't \""refresh\"" the room for a two-night stay unless requested.  I found that odd for the price. Bathroom was nice and of a decent size.  Breakfast is served downstairs but not included.  Hotel is pet-friendly and we met plenty of dogs in the lobby.  Coffee served daily in the lobby. Close to many restaurants and breweries and a decent walk to Target Field.  I'm not sure what the \""luxurious amenities\"" are that the TA blurb says are in the rooms. \n\nAgain,  if money is no object and you are twenty-five and looking for a scene, this would be the place for you.  Although we had a comfortable stay, I would say it was an average experience for the price for my family.  We didn't have any \""amazing experiences\""  or \""second-to-none service\"" and although I'm looking for a reason to give it another star, I just can't find it.",3,negative

One of the issues we encountered was rudeness and a lack of kindness from a male front desk staff who seemed to be a manager. Upon waking up from our first night at the Hewing, there was a fire alarm. This happens, we weren't upset. However, you could tell that one of the male front desk staff (assuming he is a manager) was very on edge and rude. We had an issue with our room key not working, and my partner went down to remedy the issue. The man working downstairs curtly told my partner that we had missed checkout and needed to get our things out ASAP...even though we had another night booked. I went downstairs to try to remedy the situation AGAIN, and wanted to inquire about staying another night. He barely said anything to me, let alone did NOT apologize for the inconvenience or his assumptions. I felt extremely blown off and when we decided to not stay another night, he was obviously more irritated and walked away. \nThe same day, Friday 7\u002F19, we had a very pushy bartender at the rooftop pool who told us several times that the pool would be closing and we shouldn't be up there - even though the pool area was full with other people and the pool, in fact - never closed that day. When we checked out the next day, and were asked how our stay was, I replied that is was okay and could have been a lot better. The response we got was a smile and to have a good day.

Spending on average of $350 a night, for 5 nights, the level of service is just not there yet. \n\nThe good:\n-Cool design and decor in guest rooms and lobby\n-Great views from rooftop bar\n-Yummy drinks in the bar\n-Great location and walkable to many restaurants and shops. \n-Housekeeping did a great job each day. \n\nThe not so good:\n-My room did not have hot water for two days. While the problem was eventually fixed, the lack of follow through or compensation was not great. \n-The rooftop bar ran out of straws. I had to ask the server to come up with a solution instead of just saying, \u201Csorry, we are out\u201D.\n-Bar food was just ok. Over cooked and lacked a ton of flavor.\n-You have to go downstairs to get complimentary coffee. \n-Unable to preorder breakfast after day one, since my door hanger was never replaced. \n-Location of my room faced a noisy street overlooking a Cabernet girls club. \n-Noise from the lobby bar was so loud in my room until after 1am. \n-Arrival from valet\u002Fbell was non existing. Wasn\u2019t greeted once upon arrival or welcomed back each time I came back to hotel... which was numerous times. \n-No desk space to work on laptop. Not ideal for the business traveler. \n\nAll in all, your staff can make or break the guest experience.

So I didn't know I could just check in with my phone, that wasn't conveyed by the person who booked the room, but as someone who always loses a room key or two knowing I could come and go with my phone was a monumental revalation. \n\nAs soon as I walked in the door I could tell this was a brand new place; it had that exciting feel. I was greeted very promptly by a sweetheart of a person named Lowell who could not have been a better ambassador for the hotel or Minneapolis. (I'm sure whatever he does after graduating from UofM will be amazing, but if I were Radisson RED I'd hold on to him!)\n\nI loved the hip and modern atmosphere as soon as I walked it. It was clean without being cold. It was modern with just the right splashes of color and fun. I'm not actually a huge fan of modern because it traditionally seems to go for image rather than comfort, but they had the perfect combo at Radisson Red, it was chic but didn't feel like you were in a mausoleum.\n\nI went up to my room and was so pleased. I texted instantly to my husband that \""it was the coolest room I've been in in years.\"" and I've been in a ton of hotel rooms over the years. I LOVED the hardwood floors- so did my allergies and asthma. And even though it's a very pet-friendly place (YAY) you would NEVER know it because it's so clean. I loved the picnic style table work station. There were a ton of plugs and outlets. It was just so welcoming and comforting.\n\nThe ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars if for the same issues many of the other reviewers had- they either needed more women or drag queens assisting with the design of the bathroom. While it also was sleek and \""looked good\"" it wasn't functional for someone like me who had to curl her hair in the morning and apply her make-up there as NO place to put anything. Maybe they could add an expanding shelf or like a Murphy bed counter space? I get wanting to keep things simple, but you HAVE to remember practical as well. I also (as fun as it was to look at) had issues actually using the square toilet. Umm, why? -that's all I got to say about that. And the shower, well, it was half open and the knobs (another super modern twist) were at the back and you had to think and figure out how and what you were doing with them. My 5 year old would have probably figured it out instantly, but it was kind of a mind puzzle brain teaser. Just saying thank God I wasn't in a hurry.\n\nThen I popped downstairs for a drink and some din-din and I was served by another amazing rep for the hotel. Aji (pronouced AG) he was so darling and sweet and fun and most importantly, as a customer, he was attentive. All of my drinks were incredible, but my salad sadly was not. And being all about true costumer service  they asked what was wrong, I shared, they thanked me for my honest feedback, acknowledged they were working to make their menu as awesome as possible; and they did removed that item from my bill. I'm sure they will work out the kinks with the salad, but a true Fail-Safe is the fried pickles. Absolutely delicious. Not everyone can do fried pickles well.\n\nI didn't really get to explore Downtown, but from what I read and saw the hotel is ideally located to get around the city. \n\nI would absolutely stay here again, I'll just bring a mirror of something so I won't have to use the toilet top to rest my toiletries.",4,positive

data/ca/43323/11024411/631482391.html,Radisson Red Minneapolis,"""We booked this hotel because we wanted to be close to the US Bank Stadium for the football game we were going to see.  We were also going to be venturing to the Mall of America but it was more important for us to be close to the stadium knowing it would be easier to take transportation to the mall on a Saturday than try to get to the stadium on a Sunday.\n\nOur flight into Minneapolis got us there by 9:00 so we took a shuttle to the hotel just to drop our suitcase off in their storage area because check-in wasn't until the afternoon.  However, when we got there at 9:30 and asked if we could just leave our bag, the employee said they had rooms available already and let us check in basically 8 hours early!  This was really great, as we were tired from the very early flight and it gave us a chance to just settle in for a little bit before heading to the mall.\n\nOne block behind this hotel is the light rail stop at the stadium.  We took the rail to the mall and it was about a 20 minute ride.  Very easy and convenient (I wouldn't take the rail again but that had nothing to do with the hotel and everything to do with passengers).  The light rail also stops at the airport so if you didn't want to spend the money on a shuttle or Uber, you could take the rail right to this hotel.\n\nWe had a room on the third floor way, way down the hallway and for the most part it was quiet.  There is no carpet in the rooms so one of the only complaints I do have is that the people who were staying above us had noisy shoes on (i.e. someone was wearing heels or something like that) and they were noticeable for awhile.  Also, the hotel is across the street from a fire department.  While there weren't many incidents of trucks leaving, when they did, you could hear the sirens a bit.\n\nThe beds were comfortable and cozy.  The one light was so fancy that we couldn't figure out how to turn it off the first few times!  But we got the hang of it.  We had a king bed room that came with a locker-type closet and a desk with a couple of mis-matched chairs that were really fun.\n\nThe bathroom is very open.  The square toilet through me off for a minute!  The shower has both a rain shower head and regular wand.  It took a bit for me to get the water temperature correct and I never could get a really hot shower, but that's ok.  There is no door to the shower so it does feel a little bit cooler as you are showering.\n\nWe ate one supper and one breakfast at the restaurant.  It was good...decent choices for a quick meal.  Breakfast on a Vikings game day was very busy so I would suggest going down early if that's what you are there for.\n\nOutside of the hotel is an area for Ubers and shuttles to drop off\u002Fpick up passengers and that was very convenient, as we used those services several times.\n\nOn game day, the stadium was right behind the hotel and we just walked.  I'm glad we decided to stay very close to the stadium because the traffic and parking was clearly terrible.\n\nThere are fun little amenities at the hotel, like a shuffleboard table and ping pong table.\n\nOne point I can't stress enough because it's a big deal to me is that the pillows were a good size.  I often take my own pillow because I have to sleep on something flatter and usually hotel pillows are massive and puffy, which hurts my neck.  These were great!\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay and I will certainly stay here again for future visits.",4,positive

For us, we were in town for something else, and there were no issues.  Modern hotel, and it embraces it fully.  I loved it.  Really liked the incorporation of 'Red' in everything - from the wall art to the shower art, the doors entering the building...loved it all.  Maria at the front desk may have provided the best check-in service I have ever received in years of traveling. Quick, accurate, and friendly. Genuinely interested why we came to town, and offering tips\u002Ftricks on how to navigate to places easier.  Also offering to help us get to our event that night, and find us transportation if needed, so that we didn't have to worry about the hassle (it was over in the construction-laden theatre district, a mess for people that live there...a nightmare for out of towners!!)\n\nThe only issues I had were minor.  After the event, we came back at 11.30pm on a Saturday night.  I wish there were an option at that time for a soda, snack, etc.  Nothing fancy, just something.  I didn't care to travel to a bar at that time as I was tired, but nothing between the event and us other than bars.  Something at the hotel would've been nice.  \n\nAlso, luck of the draw had us below a set of guests that had no clue how to walk properly and stomped across the floor the entire night.  No fault of the hotel, and I'm sure it's limited to who gets that situation, but it was a bit annoying!\n\nFinally, the parking option is there but was a bit steep for us for the 1 night we were staying.  We opted for the less costly garage across the street - but that comes with no in\u002Fout privileges.  Make sure you pick the option best suited for you!  And avoid the 'park whiz' app if you choose the garage across the street - the passes wouldn't scan and we wound up paying at the gate after already paying in the app.  Note though - NONE of this is the hotel's doing, only putting it so you can make the right call for your situation if you're staying!  \n\nWould definitely stay here again when in town, depending on our budget and if we can get a deal again. The 'regular' price here is a bit higher than we can usually spend, especially for multi-night stays.  If it is in your budget though - it's a great place that is highly recommended!

Talk about disgusting. We didn't bother telling them about it as we didn't want to change rooms as we were checking out in the morning. Every staff member we encountered were friendly and accommodating, or the ranking would have been worse. At check out, after we told them about the drain, they waived the internet fee, further proving my point on good service. The next night we checked into another place for less that was EASILY a 4 star with free internet and 19 dollars for indoor parking and it cost about 40% less for the night. I suppose this Marriott might have good rooms, but my money says they see \""Hotwire\"" and they give you their worst room and see how many ways they can extra bill you.",2,negative

I then asked Valet to take it to the front desk so that they could send it to my home address.

I would not want Steve the manager to ever work for my business he has no customer skills. At that time I ask Steven if I could speak to the GM of the hotel and his entire attitude changed.

They charge you for everything including if you want a mini fridge. They have no microwaves which most hotels have as a standard. The two bottles of water in your room cost $4 for the smaller bottle and $6 for larger. You're better off getting water from target, but have to use ice or drink warm or pay $10 for a very tiny fridge. For a high priced downtown hotel they do not clean rooms well. The previous guest had covered the smoke sensor with a hairy napkin so that they could smoke inside. Luckily engineers came and removed it when I called front desk. I wanted to report it so they didn't try to charge me. I didn't have any food while there so cannot comment. It is not a very sound reduction hotel. Could hear the traffic easily outside and the construction going on downstairs and I was on the 4th floor. Only good thing was the bed was super comfortable. I was in an accessible room and the auto door button did not work. Luckily I was travelling with someone who could open the door for me as I use a walker.",2,negative

This appeared to be correct as everything was in very nice condition, from the lobby furnishings and hotel carpeting to the condition of the room. There was a very refreshing and comfortable ambiance to the whole lobby, restaurant and lounging area. The previous bank architecture of marble columns and vaulted ceilings were in contrast to the wooden furniture and see through fireplace in the lounge area. The Spyhouse coffee shop was nestled in the back of the lobby area surrounded by an area five times the size of your local Starbucks with intimate seating areas, the see through fireplace and several cushions throughout. The bar area and restaurant were also very clean and offered an interesting offering of cocktails and wines. Speaking of wines, the manager showed us one of the conference rooms which used to be a vault complete with the original doors with no serves as a wine storage. Only a couple detractors were: 1) the pillows our room. The bed was extremely comfortable; however, the pillows were so thick they gave both of us very stiff necks. In their defense, we did not ask for any other pillows so were not sure if they were available. 2) There was no on site parking, nor reasonable parking service\u002Fvalet. The cars were parked a block or so away so retrieval took a while (15 minutes calling ahead) and it was expensive (at least by my standards) at $45 a night.

With so many large corporations, sports, and other attractions, there is a high demand for hotel space. Minneapolis has older and newer hotels, but I prefer modern hotels over historic, for the most part, and this is why I like the DoubleTree Hilton University area.\n\nI stayed at this hotel over the weekend while on a beer tour of the Minneapolis\u002FSt. Paul area in support of my web site, Great Beer Now, and liked what I experienced. First, the location- it is very close to the University of Minnesota and that means it is walking distance from many attractions in the area. The check- in was efficient and I liked the attentiveness and care shown by the valet parking team. They took care of my vehicle quickly and had it ready when I needed it. And, of course, you receive warm cookies upon checking in, always a nice added touch. \n\nWith the rooms, the first thing that struck me was the spaciousness. There is plenty of walking area between the king size bed and the television\u002Fdesk area. Plus, my room had seating for up to five people. The room was squeaky clean and I like that I couldn\u2019t hear ANY outside noises at all; a vast improvement over some hotels, where I could distinctly hear private conversations taking place in the room next to me. \n\nAnother reason to like this modern hotel is the attention to details. One thing I noticed immediately is that the large showers have the faucet knob placed on the end opposite the shower head. This means that, when you reach in to start the flow of water and get the temperature just right, you don\u2019t have to stand under the water first. You\u2019re on the opposite end, away from the actual flow of water. When I first noticed this, all I could think of was \u2018why didn\u2019t anyone else think of this?\u2019 It\u2019s one of those simple enhancements that make a difference and yet most people don\u2019t even think of doing it until someone or someplace else takes the lead. I noticed other, similar extras that place this hotel well above other places of lodging.\n\nDoubleTree Hilton University Area has a bar and restaurant for your convenience, so you\u2019re never very far from food and drink. They offer complementary hotel shuttle service so long as it\u2019s within a short distance- about 5 miles- and the staff is friendly and ready to help.

The radio was off, just like I left it 10 minutes prior.  After getting the item, the car had to be driven around the block to access the hotel entrance again. As it was busy, the manager \""Gary\"" had come to help valet and took care of my car.\nThe next day I got in my car and the radio was left on, but barely any volume. And it was on a local station not programmed into the pre-sets. So besides turning on the radio, the person had to scroll through 2 screens to switch it from \""map\"" to \""radio\"" and then to FM and then find the particular radio station.  \nSo what else did this person do in my car? What else did this person feel free to access in my car?  And that the employees identified my description of the person as the manager on duty the prior evening makes it even more disturbing. I did ask that the manager on duty that morning be informed of what happened, but I did not receive any communications about the incident. \nEveryone else was extremely pleasant and I would have highly recommended the hotel.

It had one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.  The towels are absolutely luxurious.\n\nThe staff is very helpful and made us feel welcome.\n\nIn short, we had a very great visit.",5,positive
data/ca/43323/11403204/658058586.html,Doubletree by Hilton Minneapolis - University Area,"""We stayed here once before and I knew it wasn't perfect but we were too late to nab a room at the Graduate which is hands down better located on campus, and because the DT does NOT offer complimentary shuttle service (shuttle service must be contracted with the hotel) staying here during inclement weather is not appealing.  You either need to walk or pay for uber.  It's worth considering this when thinking of booking here.  We put on miles as we traveled back and forth more than once a day for an athletic event in slush, wind and snow.  The only parking on site is valet. Despite in\u002Fout privileges this is still a hassle and makes you feel slightly stuck and paying a lot to house your car while staying.  Some opt to park at the Oak street parking ramp which is about 2 blocks away, but you still need to schlep back and forth from here - possibly with luggage in tow.  The main entrance is the valet park stop with minimal space to stop and unload.  Driving around the building there is another door on the side where cars will be brought back from valet.  This setup was not well designed.  That side door is directly next to the elevators so at busy times you will encounter many people waiting with luggage for their car and people trying to squeeze around to get on\u002Foff the elevators in one narrow hallway.  And the door to get outside is not automatic so you'll have to hope for some nice person to help you with the door if you have your hands full of luggage.  To add fun to the experience, try doing this with a luggage cart.\nWhen we first arrived at a non-busy time, there were 2 people standing inside the entryway at the valet stand.  Neither came out as we unloaded our luggage and made a pile on the sidewalk. I finally had to walk in and ask if either was the valet and one young man said yes.  I then had to ask if I should leave the car running or what.  At that time he finally got a ticket ready for me to get validated at the front desk. Nice welcome - he should have come out immediately to greet us and get our information.  I'm assuming he was not fully trained on his duties as a valet.\nWe reserved a king bed\u002F2 room suite.  It is generous on size but odd in some ways.  There is no entryway closet or coatrack of any kind.  We had to carry our coats and other things all the way into the bedroom to find a hanging closet.  The entryway had a mirror and kitchenette.  The kitchenette had a small microwave in a cabinet with a door and the frig was in a cabinet with a door.  Why?  Double the work to get access.  The microwave had a plate in it that did not fit so it would bounce around each time we used it.  There was absolutely nothing else in the kitchenette area (dishes, soap, towels  - nothing).  There was a hotel-style coffee maker, ice maker and glasses.  All the cupboards and drawers in the entire suite were empty.  Somewhat normal except for the fact that the sofa bed had no bedding and I needed to call for that.  I'm not sure why that isn't stored in the suite - there's more than enough room.\nAs I mentioned the suite is huge - plenty of room for a family to stay combined with the sofa bed.  However, it's actually quite stark.  The walls in the entry way and around towards the bathroom and bedroom are bare, but certainly a hanging closet or something could be added and seems necessary after having stayed there during weather that required ample outwear that needed hanging and drying.  I ended up feeling I was staying more at a budget type hotel - the furniture was cheap and the place so stark and bare and staring to show wear and tear.  Oddly, there was some pipe or something in the wall near the door that would sometimes starting thumping rhythmically.  I'd say it was like a pipe that suddenly had hot water running through it.  It was distracting at night and we had to close the bedroom door in hopes to mask it until it stopped.  We also needed to close our bedroom door to muffle the sounds of people arriving later at night and talking in the hallway.  Without the bedroom door we would certainly have been bothered more by sound traveling through the outer door.  Another point is the tvs.  We didn't spend gobs of time watching tv but like to turn on the news or wind down at night.  It took more than one call to get 2 working remotes for the 2 tvs.  Then the tvs were not setup correctly.  The guide didn't work because the date was set to Dec. 31.  It was an absolute pain to jump channels to find what was actually on.  Oh, one remote that we had to have replaced was almost sticky coated in goo.  Thankfully the new one seemed to be clean.\nThere is a small fitness center.  It is totally suitable except it needs more attention.  The lysol wipes ran out our second day and were never replaced.  I reported a malfunctioning treadmill which was never fixed.  We did not use the pool area but there is a very nicely sized spa in there!  The onsite bar and restaurant look nice but never too busy.  I just think the hotel is too off the beaten path.  OMG, in comparison, The Graduate hotel was overflowing at times during the weekend.\nOne other point I noted last time we stayed - the barn door on the bathroom just isn't designed properly.  In this last room they did cut out a notch from the floor board on one side so the door would close all the way, but on the other, the floorboard holds the door away from the wall so you don't get the best privacy in the bathroom.  Unless you are totally comfortable with your roommates you will not like this.  The door also doesn't have any type of latch or lock so hope your roommates understand what a closed door means.\nAs you can tell, I just wanted overly impressed.  I felt we payed a good price for that room and at first I was pleased about size, etc.. but upon closer use and inspection, I felt I was paying a 4 star price for a 2-3 star room.  \nI'd say employees were overall professional and nice with a few exceptions like the valet or the man who checked us in.  That person gave us erroneous information about the shuttle and didn't give us our complimentary waters for being HH members.  I did get this the next day and think again this is due to some lack of training.\nMy recommendation - either plan for the walking (or paying for uber) or find a hotel with complimentary shuttle service.",3,negative

Many others are within a few blocks again location is a huge plus on this one. Lobby has many sitting areas that are comfortable and great for meeting up with friends. ",4,positive

The property has a great location, it's right by the US Bank Stadium for the Vikings games and close to the Guthrie Theater (we were there to see \""A Christmas Carol\"") and close to a number of great eateries. Parking was somewhat of a pain. The lobby is kind of different, it has a chic and college dorm lobby feel to it if that makes any sense. The rooms are simple and again had a college dorm room feel to them. I didn't care for them myself, I felt the room was cold and not very comfy. Neither my wife or myself cared for the beds or pillows and the television didn't work very well and had no HD channels that we could find (which by the way is really just trivial). To their credit the staff that we met were very friendly and courteous. A big plus that we liked was the shuttle that took us and dropped us off at dinner and then came and picked us back up....big plus. I hate to take anything away from this hotel because it does have a number of very good reviews, I just think it wasn't quite our style and for that reason I don't know that we'd visit again.",3,negative

I only had to walk a couple of blocks to get to my meeting in the Mill City Museum building. I felt comfortable in the area walking by myself during the day. Check in\u002Fout was quick and easy. I utilized the underground parking for an extra fee. It was heated and was I able to get to hotel elevator using key card. Came into an area of the hotel that could be kept neater if guests use same area.  I did not utilize any of the amenities. Room was clean and comfortable. Decor is not your typical hotel decor, but pleasant. Bed was comfortable, but a little firmer than I'm used to. I like a pretty soft mattress though. Numerous pillows were on bed, they were comfortable once found the correct combo. I heard a lot of 'clicks' from hallway from inside room and refrigerator was a little loud when it ran, but nothing too bothersome. I just turned the fan on the adjustable thermostat to 'on' instead of auto to help cover. Body wash and shampoo\u002Fconditioner in one provided in dispenser in shower.

There was a coffee maker and coffee in room, although I did not use. Hairdryer was in room to use. Also had two complimentary bottles of water which were convenient.

data/ca/43323/1142487/465147398.html,Aloft Minneapolis,"""My son was auditioning for the BFA program at University of Minnesota and I must say this is probably the best hotel for that! Why? It is the ideal location as it is only 1 block from the Guthrie Theater and a few minutes drive from the Rarig Center. Our hotel room was reasonably priced. The decor is nice and has a lot of amenities (free coffee, pool, fitness center, ping-pong and pool table etc). This is the first time I stayed at a Aloft hotel but my impression is that it is a contemporary, casual, clean, and no-frills hotel. For example, they had a small area to purchase snacks, sandwiches, and breakfast items. To my surprise, the breakfast items were very reasonably priced. Basically, I didn't feel like I was being fleeced just because I am staying at a hotel. BTW, there is also a coffee shop across the street that is open six days a week.\n\nAn unique aspect is if you turned down housecleaning for the entire stay, they will credit your $5 towards the store (where you can buy snacks and breakfast items) or award you points. Wi-Fi is free and fast, pets are welcome, and there is even a refrigerator in the room.\n\nAs I said before, location is ideal to see a Guthrie event or audition for the BFA program at Rarig. Note that it is on the west bank and not in the main U of M campus. However, getting to the main campus is a short drive away and it never took us more than 10 mins. However, note that it is in a less populated area (good and bad). Less traffic, more available street parking, but less restaurants and places to walk to. It is very safe (as far as I can tell), but realistically, you are not really going to walk anywhere except to the restaurant and coffee shop across the street. There is also a park two blocks away (next to the Guthrie Theater) if you just want to walk around or do some jogging.\n\nThe only cons I have about the place are 1) the front desk people were hits or misses. While I was there for three nights, there were some very friendly and helpful staff while a couple of them were also very unfriendly and didn't seem like they want to be there. and 2) You didn't need to buzz in with your keycard at night. It seems like anyone can just walk in and out of the hotel. I was able to walk in at night from the back without having to buzz in with my card. I guess safety is not an issue in that area? Lastly, it is very close to the US Bank stadium. I wasn't there when the Vikings are playing or when they are having a big event. As such, I am not sure what the traffic or congestion would be like when they do.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the stay for the price. A great place especially for parents that are taking their kids to visit U of M (and especially if your kid is auditioning for the BFA program).",4,positive

The location is excellent; very close to the river, the US Bank Stadium, the Guthrie Theater and the Mill City Museum.  It's just four or five blocks off the highway.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are comfortable and reasonably large. The bar, WXYZ, is excellent; the barkeep is very knowledgeable about the local beers, and I saw her mixing up some cool cocktails.  There were a number of people from the local neighborhood in the bar, which gave it an atmosphere quite unlike a typical hotel bar.  The food menu at the bar is simple, but it's good; I was there with my daughter, who's a vegetarian, and she gave the veggie burger her nod of approval.  \n\nThere are a few things to be wary of, however.  The first is it's very noisy.  Washington Ave is busy, and there seemed to be a steady stream of emergency vehicles going along it, sirens blaring, at all hours.  The in-room heating\u002Fcooling unit is powerful, but extremely noisy.  There seemed to be a lot of people walking up and down the corridor and while they certainly weren't shouting, theirs voices seemed to echo around the room.  Maybe the walls are just too thin.  The other odd thing about the room is that the bathroom has two areas - the first has the sink, and this area is open to the rest of the room.  The shower and toilet are in a separate area, with a sliding door.  But there's only one switch for the lights in both areas, which means your partner gets disturbed if you visit the bathroom at night and turn on the light.  This is bizarre and irritating.  Couldn't they afford two light circuits?\n\nThe hotel has a few parking spots in the alley behind the building; good luck getting one.  You'll end up parking in the municipal multi-story car park in the next block, which is perfectly convenient  (it's open 24 hours) but it's going to add a few bucks to the cost of your stay.",4,positive

If not, book elsewhere.  I rate this hotel a one for sleep comfort.\n    *  The lighting is very confusing.

There is no curbside entrance that allows you to park and unload. By going to the alley you will find an ALOFT sign with ten parking spots (all filled). We then proceeded back around the building and made the assumption we had to pay $8 for parking across the street, then pull luggage across the street and through the alley. Walking in we were obviously confused and looking for the hotel desk. Had we been two healthy adults this wouldn't have been such a task, but my husband is a paraplegic and I finished surgery #7 this year after a fall. So trying to do this from a wheelchair and scooter was frustrating. We weren't greeted and I was forced to ask if we were where we were supposed to be to check in (a circular desk in the back of the building) . We did what we had to (which was no small task) and then asked for directions to the elevator to ascend to our third floor accessible room. The keypad is located on the door itself which makes it hard to swipe\u002Fturn handle and enter from a chair. This led to a hallway within the room. It was warm in the room, but we were unable to get to the thermostat since the bed frame is mounted inches from the wall. Only one outlet was accessible as the rest are located under counters or under the desk, so if you cant crawl you are out of luck. The mini frig sits under the vanity counter so unless you can get on knees to reach back it is unusable. The worst part of the room is the beds. A painted platform sits 5 inches off the floor and a mattress is placed on top of it. The top of the mattress came to the middle of my calf, but not being complainers we gave it a go. We literally try to roll and claw our way out. The mattress slides on the platform. After many tries I succeeded by grasping my husbands wheelceir for leverage. However, he struggled to try to scoot from the bed up to his chair. The mattresses are horrible and provided for sleepless nights. The bathroom was accessible (no fan) although since it is a roll in shower additional bath mats or towels should have been left as the bathroom flooded. There were only two towels in the room. We are very unsatisified and consider this a studio room for a young millennial, with no prospect of accessibility without on remodel. Lack of friendliness avails throughout.

The refrigerator did not work.  Don't they check this when preparing the room for a new guest?  We reported it in the morning and returned in the evening to find that it was still not working.  They did send someone up on the second request who replaced the refrigerator.  The family member had breakfast included on a prior stay.  Apparently that has changed, which is our fault for not checking.  However, when we went down for a bagel, the price of $3 was listed, but the clerk rang it up and said it was $4.  When I explained that they should honor the posted price the clerk had no idea how to do that.  There was no manager available.  At this point I suggested that she really needed to give us the bagels for free if she could not ring up the posted price, so she said we should just take them.  The posted price was then corrected.  They do not provide parking.  They don't even reserve a couple of spaces for use during check-in.  Parking is available at a municipal lot across the street for $9 for 24 hours.  However, when we arrived the lot was full due to a big evening event in the area on a Sunday night.  We found a spot at an adjoining business that would open at 7AM.  We didn't want to get up that early to move the car, so we moved the car over to the municipal lot at 11PM after the event crowd had left.    The room had only one desk chair.

Marsha is extremely accommodating and welcoming, as she would personally prepare breakfast at any time needed (and it tasted great too - I joined my parents on their last morning and was impressed with the freshly prepared fruit, high quality coffee and delicious pastries, which was a lighter version of the bigger weekend breakfasts that offered Swedish pancakes and quiche!). Marsha even allowed the use of the dining room for my parents to host extended family for a dessert night.

There were several long black strands of hair in and about our bathroom, however the rest of the room appeared to be clean.

Only 1 window had a working screen, which made the room warmer than we prefer, I am assuming central air was (is) the means of cooling, but the front larger bedroom gets a lot of sun and it got warm.  In other reviews it speaks of ample wonderful breakfasts, ours were average.  Day 1 melon, croissants, Swedish pancakes and bacon, all very good.  Day 2, bowl of blueberries, quiche(burned on bottom) and muffins, very average this day.

This is what made our stay a four star vs a five. Mostly little things that piled up: some irritations that a lot of people might find annoying, some our own personal preferences based on our travel habits.\n\nAs we mentioned, they only have one room with a king bed, which is their most spacious room. A gorgeous room, but it was around $300 a night, which in our experience is a little pricey for Minneapolis. \n\nAs other reviewers have stated, it can get a little noisy. (They do provide earplugs in the rooms. We use a fan app on our phone, which is a lifesaver when traveling.) We personally didn't notice any restaurant noise, but there was a troop of very loud guests going back to their rooms some time after midnight. It is a boutique hotel, and the hallway and room spacing is not what you'd get at, say, a Marriott, so the volume is a bit more intense as a result. Not a big deal for us, but if indeed you were bothered by noise or whatever, there is no attendant on site at the hotel from (we believe) midnight through to 6:00 a.m. - so you'd have to call them and wait for someone to arrive and fix the issue, which could be a bit of a drag.\n\nWe were mostly bothered by the light pollution: the large drapes didn't shut all the way (some clips would totally fix that issue), and the smoke detector had a blinking white light right above the bed. \n\nThe furniture was really hip but a little impractical: the chairs in our room were super low to the ground and are not the easiest things to get in and out of. There is no wine or beer offered in the minibar, and no corkscrew. :(\n\nThey have parking in a lot behind the hotel\u002Frestaurant, but for reasons we didn't quite get, we needed to hand over our keys so they could move the car if necessary....not sure if they were scrambling to share the parking with restaurant diners, or what was going on, but explaining that we needed our car at 7:30 pm but would probably be back after the front desk closed so would we still have a parking spot...? It all worked out, but the bottom line is that it seems like they have too few spaces for the amount of cars. Hotel guests should just have their own designated parking space. \n\nThe bathroom shower water pressure was not very strong (giant pet peeve). \n\nThere were no hand towels or washcloths in our room, so it seems housekeeping didn't check everything thoroughly. Not an issue as you can call down right away -  unless the front desk is closed for the evening. \n\nWe realize some of these things are totally nitpicky, but on the other hand, for $300 a night, one shouldn't have to call down to get hand towels or wish we had packed a sleep mask.

The Staff is great.  we stayed here last year following our wedding and then stayed here for our anniversary - it is a wonderful tradition at a wonderful place.  Pairing a stay here with dinner is the way to go.  You then wake up to a very nice continental breakfast delivered to your room when you want it, comprised of juice, coffee or team and a basket of either pastries or breads - which are wonderful.  A great hotel for a short break.",5,positive

However, is excellent in its niche.  \n\nSome of the nice features. \n\nGreat location.  An easy walk to the University of Minnesota and local restaurants.   The walks are a great time for nostalgia or gratitude that you no longer live in student housing.   \n\nFree parking.   A hotel in a large city that does not charge $25-$50 a day for parking is rare.\n\nBlackout shades.   It was such a treat to sleep in without the sun bursting through gaps in curtains or just blasting through lightweight curtains.  With shade drawn (even at midday on a sunny day) the room was dark!\n\nShort hallways.   No hunting for the right bank of elevators or walking corridors seemingly miles long.\n\nReasonable costs.  The lobby shop (although limited to necessities) offers many things for 50 cents, not $2.50 for package of two aspirin. \n\nSpacious rooms.  I was very pleasantly surprised, even a min-kitchen.   \n\n Relatively quiet.  Any hotel in a big city can be noisy.  The University Inn was fine.   I had room 211 on the highway side.  If I listened carefully, I could identify the traffic sounds but it was not loud.  To be precise, sound levels were around 55 db.  For the non-engineers reading, the squeak of the office chair at the desk registered 57db.

We've been there so often the front desk clerk remembered us this visit. She is very friendly. It is very conveniently located close to the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and just a few minutes off hwy 35W. This hotel is a very good value for the money. The nightly rate when we stayed in March 2017 was $129 a night, the same as 6 months ago. It's not fancy. The hallways remind me of a college dorm room hallway. All rooms have a table and chairs, desk with a chair, kitchenette with toaster, refrigerator, dishes, microwave and two burner cooktop. There is a coin operated laundry on the lower level, snacks for purchase in the lobby, and free coffee and hot chocolate in the lobby. The beds are extremely comfortable. I always sleep very well there. It's not often I find a hotel with pillows that remain comfortable throughout the night. Parking is a free private surface lot right next to the entrance to the hotel.\n\nIf you want to go for a walk on a nice day, it's only a 15-18 minute walk to the Stone Arch bridge over the Mississippi River which is a pedestrian bridge with spectacular views of Minneapolis, the Mississippi River and St. Anthony Falls. The Mill district and Guthrie Theater are located on the opposite side of the river.\n\nIf you forget an umbrella or ice scraper, they have them for purchase.

Most importantly, the main door that's supposed to lock does not and not only does the front desk staff not greet everyone, but at night, they're often not even there. That's a major safety concern.\n\nFirst, I want to say the cleaning staff were great. They were super helpful and always friendly.\u00A0\nSecond, I want to note this was not a single overnight for me. I was here for 6 nights.\u00A0\n\nFront desk staff: I'm used to walking into a hotel and someone saying \""Hello. Are you checking in?\"". When I arrived, I was the only person in the lobby and I stood directly in front of the person at the front desk for at least 30 seconds of silence before I began the convo with \""Hi. I'm checking in.\""\u00A0Some staff were great, some wore University Inn shirts, some did not. Some never spoke to me when I entered or exited the whole week. One night I came in just after midnight and I had a question. When I entered the unlocked door, the front desk was empty. I stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. Then I took a seat. 15 minutes later I got up and approached the desk again, I couldn't believe no staff had arrived nearly 20 mins later. I saw a sign on the front desk counter that said they'd be right back and left a number to call if you needed something. So I called the number. It rang the front desk phone that was 2 feet in front of me at an empty desk that went unanswered. I waited for another minute then went back to my room.\u00A0\n\nFront Door Lock: When I checked in I was told that the front door would lock after 5pm and that I would have to use my key card. The lock was clearly broken, it had tape over it. And old tape too. I assume staff were just told to tell guests that to give the illusion of safety. In a week's time, that front door did not lock once, not at 5pm, not at 10pm, not at 2am. Anyone could walk in that building at any time, which is particularly concerning as several times late at night, the front desk went unstaffed.\n\u00A0\nSmoking: People smoking in general is not typically an issue for me. I smoked for 20 years. I get it. Walking towards my room, the hallway smelled of cigarettes, I figured some college kid was cheekily smoking in their room. Whatever. When I walked into my room after check in, I thought for sure it had been a smoking room. It was so strong, it seeped into the wooden cabinets and they even they smelled. I went down to ask for a room change, which they gave me,\u00A0 and they explained that that rooms a\u002Fc was right next to where everyone smokes outside the front entrance. So the smoke literally gets sucked into the rooms, hence, into the hallways.\u00A0This, to me, seemed like a large issue with an easy solution...have people smoke 15 feet away on the other side of the building that doesn't have a\u002Fc vents or even just a few feet into the parking lot, away from the building.\n\nWhich leads me to, the little things that add up. Smaller issues with seemingly simple fixes that have gone overlooked for some time speak volumes. It communicates to me that management is aiming for the minimum. I've included a bunch of pictures to illustrate this.They include: a broken curtain rod, mold on the ceiling, writing on the door frame dated a year ago, tourism magazine from 2017 in 2019, fraying bath mats, sparse and thrown around silverware, jacked up a\u002Fc unit vents, a cracked sink.\nOk, so a cracked sink isn't an easy fix, but for nearly a year, no one took some cleaner to the 2018 graffiti, tourism books are free and at all the truck stops\u002Fgas stations, one squeeze of super glue would reconnect the curtain to the rod, a little white paint with Kilz would cover the spot of mold...etc.\n\nThe cleaning crew seemed quite competent, which leads me to believe not doing above the standard linens and flat surfaces is a specific order. I'm quite sure the front desk staff was well aware the front door didn't lock, but were told to say it does anyways.If I understand this correctly, this all falls under poor management, not the employees.\nSo it may not be your worst stay, but it will not be a Trip Advisor 4.5 star stay.",2,negative

The cleanliness was off the charts in a bad way.  I did not spend much time in the room and did my best to ensure that none of my clothes or items touched the carpet, which is in dire need of a vaccuuming.  There were also random hairs and stains on the bedding I was given.  As I was alone I received a single room on the third floor.

What I got was space in a 4 bed dormitory that shared a bathroom with another women's dorm, for $33\u002Fnight.  The house is old, needs work to be brought up to hotel standards, but then the rates would go up.  I needed a bed, got clean sheets, pillowcases and a towel.  Shampoo, soap, etc?  Bring your own.

data/ca/43323/1202698/141606079.html,Minneapolis International Hostel,"""Realizing that Minneapolis International Hostel IS a hostel and not a motel \u002F hotel - I booked my reservation on good faith that it would accommodate my needs \u002F requirements. It is definitely the cheapest accommodations in the Minneapolis area and you're probably not going to locate any other location that provides a bed and shower for less money than the Hostel. I do disclaim that I had NEVER stayed in a hostel before. Thus, my review of this Hostel is based upon its own merit, and I am unable to compare this Hostel to any other hostels. My first peeve of my experience is that vehicle parking is extremely limited. The web site for the Hostel indicates that parking is free and plenty. However, the vehicle parking is somewhat limited to the city streets of Stevens & 24th Street and EVERYONE in the general community parks along these streets. I could usually park my rental vehicle within a short walking distance of the Hostel, but there were two times that I had to park a long distance away from the Hostel. My second peeve was that there was approximately two feet of spacing between the beds, where I would be subjected to having to smell the breath of the sleeping person next to me. My third peeve was that there was one full bathroom in the room for six people. There was no room \u002F hooks, or otherwise to hang the wet towel, or wash cloth to dry. My fourth peeve was that there was no cleanliness standard within the rooms. Three of the Hostel roommates had their personal belongings scattered all over their respective areas, without any regard to the cleanliness of the room for the other roommates. My fifth peeve was that there was only one television for the entire Hostel. This particular Hostel has at least twenty guest beds and one television for twenty people isn't quite adequate. On the positive side, there is free WiFi internet that seemed to work at all times and was relatively high speed. There is one community desktop computer that anyone can use. I did not have the need to use the community desktop computer, but I found that it was generally open and available to use at any time. The kitchen and dining area was immaculate in general cleanliness and there were several dishes \u002F cooking utensils and other cooking tools to use. The refrigerator was clean and organized. During my stay, I had heard that the location of the Hostel is in the \""bad part\"" of town, but I found that to be a very subjective opinion. I found that the local people were very cordial, helpful and appreciative to assist. During my stay and walks around the vicinity, I never felt fearful, unwelcome, awkward, or threatened by the locals. I can only suppose that the statements made against the local people are those that have tendency to speak on their own opinions, without knowing. The Hostel is located nearby many eateries and small retail outlets. There are many fantastic eateries and coffee shops in the area and a McDonald's nearby. Overall - the Hostel is a decent place to maintain a bed and shower, but it does lack some Space and Cleanliness issues. If I were to recommend this Hostel on budget requirements - I would definitely give a thumbs up, but if I were to recommend this Hostel on the overall space and cleanliness - I would have to give a thumbs down.",3,negative

Upon arrival we were presented with sheets and towels. They were mismatched, heavily used and stained with either house paint or someone had used them to mop a bad nose bleed. The bathroom was dirty.  But it was the kitchen that was the kicker.  The sink, cupboards, floor and appliances were not clean.

After roaming around a strange city at 10 pm, I decided to stop at the given address, which is now a Super-Valu, quite small and not easily visible. The woman at the desk (just about the only really nice element to my stay) told me I had no reservation, because they stopped taking online reservations several years ago. So who from Trip Advisor took my credit card number and charged $21.45 to it? Why was I suddenly on something called hostels.com which was charging in British pounds? Luckily, there was a vacancy because I wasn't keen on going back out to try and find another place.\nWell, let's just say this hotel has seen better days, and it looks like better days aren't ahead. On the good side, it was quiet, the bed was good, and it was pretty clean. On the bad side, the sink was beginning to fall off the wall, there was hair in the tub, and there were no outlets near the bed for my cpap. The soda machine was long defunct, there was no place to get breakfast anywhere nearby, and there appeared to be a few down & outers in residence full time. The hallways smelled heavily of smoke, and since the room was below ground level, I couldn't get cell reception. At $70 a night, this seemed quite overpriced. I do want to stress that the woman owner was a very sweet person and this appeared to be a mom-pop operation, complete with kids & dog.\nI do hope a Trip Advisor can help me out with the hijacking website and charge to my card. And take this hotel off the site, please!!",2,negative

I am a college student on a budget and just needed a room for the night after a concert so decided to take my chances as the price and location were great. I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled in and found a clean parking lot with lots of nicely planted flowers.  I should of slept in the parking lot.  The room was disgusting and I did not take my shoes off during the 14 hours I was there.  The room faced west and with no AC was ungodly hot. The door lacked the universal chain lock so I couldn't crack it open for ventilation.  When I tried to open the blinds to get to the windows the rotten cord disintegrated in my hands. Luckily someone had smashed a 4 inch by 4 inch hole in the window facing the alley so I got some air and felt oh so safe.  Why didn't I just take a dip in the pool?  The pool is tarped over and looks like it has been that way for years. Who wants to swim in August anyway? Back to the room. Electric and cable cords were tucked inside the electric heater, I'm not sure why they were out of the way because no one had vacuumed along the heater for at least a year. The ceiling lamp shade over the bed was broken in half, I don't know how it stayed up but I waited all night for it to fall on me and cut me in my sleep.  The bathroom light fixture was so mold encrusted I wondered how it kept working. I didn't have to wonder long because the (only) bathroom light quit working about 3 hours after I had been there.  At least the bathroom floor is clean now because the shower curtain was so moldy I wouldn't touch it so the floor got soaked by the shower.  Did I mention the mysterious brown liquid that covered the wall next to the bed?  I do have to admit that the sheets and towels were clean. When the phone in my room didn't work (you have to request it be turned on)the front staff was helpful in calling me a cab. However a man, with a jar of change and talking about God, and his junky girlfriend were in the lobby and the front staff had me tell them which room I was in then loudly told the cab company.

Parking was available for our car and we made full use of the transit which was within easy waling distance. We enjoyed our visit to the nearby Weisman Art Museum. The Wales House will definitely be our home away from home whenever we visit the Twin Cities.",5,positive

My partner and I were only there for a weekend, but many we met here were staying for weeks or months.  The owners offered to help us with luggage, showed the house and our room.  He also was willing to answer any questions we had about the house or the area, but for the most part the Wales House is set up in a way that you take care of yourself (which is exactly what we were looking for).  Breakfast is continental with bread, fruits, granola, cereal, milk, juice, coffee and tea available.  There is plenty of refrigerator and cubboard space for each room, so you can bring your own food, too.  We didn't cook during our stay, but there is a nice sized fully equiped kitchen available to do so.  The room we stayed in had a private bathroom with a shower (I did wish for a tub), a queen bed, hanging space, a dresser, a desk with a telephone and answering machine.  The driveway and (free)parking was plowed, the sidewalks shoveled.  It is listed as a B&B on tripadvisor, but is more of a guest house (which is stated on the website and the owners will tell you on the phone).",4,positive

You can tell its an older building and that the rooms have been updated. The rooms are pretty standard, nothing really stands out, nothing too modern, but clean. The building is a crown jewel and may still be the largest hotel in Minneapolis.\n\nThe hotel is situated in the heard of the very cosmopolitan downtown Minneapolis, very close (4-6 minute walk) to the Convention Center. Downtown Minneapolis is very cool. All the buildings are connected by 2nd story indoor walkways. You can travel all through the city and never be outside! Its amazing, and very useful for the freezing winters. The hotel connects to the Convention Center of course too. \n\nThere are many restaurants and bars within walking distance, and the MLB and NFL stadiums are also close as is the arena (there was a UFC event while we were in town). But the food at the Hotel was also very good. \n\nWe are Hilton Honors Diamond members so we booked with points, but the retail cost on the rooms is pretty high, as are the food and drink prices.

Sadly this property has gone downhill dramatically since I last visited 1 year ago.  I had a few issues related to sloppy service that are not up to the standards of the Hilton Garden brand.  Twice during my 4 night stay I had to go to the front desk because housekeeping didn't replenish my coffee pods.  One morning I awoke to discover the bathroom tissue hadn't been replenished - enough said.  On our last night one of my colleagues and I decided to have a drink in the hotel bar, we were advised by the host to take a seat at the \""island bar\"" where we waited for 10 minutes and then left after not being served.  We mentioned this to the host on the way out and he said nothing but gave us the \""deer in the headlights look.\""  Finally, I had to print an important business document in the morning before heading to a meeting, but the printer in the business center was \""down.\""  Oh, and did I mention that on the way out I went to get a coffee but the dispenser was empty?  Moreover, the cardio machines in the fitness room are old and beat up - one of the treadmills was out of order on Monday when I arrived and the one I used had the incline function broken. The out of order sign on the disabled treadmill was still there 3 days later.  This was clearly an indication that there was no plan to fix it.  This was a nice hotel before that has become a poor hotel and I must regrettably advise other travelers to avoid it.  There are plenty of good hotels in downtown Minneapolis to choose from, but this is no longer one of them.

This great hotel is a five minute walk to the Minneapolis Convention Center. \n\nValet parking: Jovyta was there at 2:30 PM when we arrived, and was there when we left at 6:30 AM. She was quick, efficient and an excellent communicator. The card she gives you when you arrives asks for a 20 minute lead time to pick up your car, being as amazing as she was, she had our car ready in ten minutes.  We weren't even in a hurry. Jovyta, you gave a great first impression when we arrived and are a valuable asset to the hotel. \n\nHotel room: Very clean and organize. Exactly what you would expect. Our room was on the 8th floor. It was quiet and we never heard anyone during our short stay. I would also like to note that we had a corner room with windows on both outside walls. This is not something we have experienced in a while. It's usually only one window. Unsure how old this hotel was.",5,positive

Out of concern, Jody called us, checked on our progress and waited as long as possible.  Upon my arrival, I walked into the room and there were a dozen roses and a beautiful card welcoming the family with condolences from the team. Day 2, there were a plate of cookies and another beautiful card. The entire family was so moved by this kind gesture. That personal touch will stay in our hearts forever.

It's located walking distance to the convention center and is centrally located to downtown. In terms of location it is great, it's right off the freeway and easily accessible to the city. The reason for the lower rating is, cleanliness. The hotel was nice enough to give us a diamond upgrade. We checked in later in the evening and didn't use the bathroom facilities until about 1am. We lift the toilet cap and there was a feces in there that hadn't been flushed. It was late and we were tired so we cleaned the toilet with Clorox wipes and informed the Ryan the manager the next morning. He said he would give us some points for the trouble. At the time of check out we checked with the front desk to see how many points they would be crediting and they said 1000. I've gotten more points on the phone for listing to a 15 min talk about timeshares and that didn't involve cleaning someone else's poo. We asked they give us more and they ended crediting us 3000 points. Not great but better than what they started at.\n\nIn addition, this Hilton was part of a \""test\"" program where Hilton wanted to see how crucial comforters were. So this hotel unlike the Garden in we just came from did not have any comforters. All they had was a thin cover over the bed like the ones you get at cheap motel rooms with the corners sewn in. When you call down to ask for a comforter they can only provide an additional fleece blanket. Hey Hilton, comforters are crucial!  \n\nParking is off site in an old boarded up building across the street, unless you want to valet for $28 a day.\n\nThe staff is nice and want to help but they seem understaffed.

I myself am a fan of the Holiday Inn chain and had never stayed at a Hilton Garden Inn before but this is where the wedding party choose for all the out of town guest.  \n\nThe location is at the outer edge of the downtown area so put on your walking shoes as it will be a 10mins walk (less then a mile) to get to the shops\u002Fbars\u002Frestaurants in the area.  If you prefer not to walk they do have an on-site restaurant\u002Fbar.  A breakfast buffet for $13 that is your standard fare of eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, cooked to order omelets, fresh fruit, cereals as well.  It's a nice selection of food well worth the $13 for the ease of not having to go anywhere else early in the morning for food.  (Did not eat lunch\u002Fdinner at this location).\n\nThey have a small pool and fitness center on the 1st floor to the left of the front desk.  Pool is 3ft to 5f deep.  Note its valet parking only at $30 a night (with tax).  They have a small parking garage in their building.  If it's full your car will be parked across the street on a private open air lot or on the ramp heading to the basement garage.  The server is quick in getting your car back to you.  You can either call ahead or just tell them at the entrance.   If $30 a night is too much for you there are several public parking garages 1 to 2 blocks from them with a little cheaper rates.  Note however no IN\u002FOUT permissions so while you can save per day if you don't plan on using your car (There is a $6 a day 3 blocks away) you can't use the car at all. \n\nThe room was nice.  Similar to a holiday inn but I think just a tad bit fancier.  The bed had a firm mattress that allows for some restful sleep.  The pillows were too soft for me. Just too mushy.  Not sure if you can ask for firmer ones.  The top cover has some weight to it, thus putting you to sleep faster and getting a restful night sleep.\n\nNoise between room could use some soundproofing.  Next door neighbor had his TV on (it was my uncle who was in the wedding party) set to level 15 and I could hear it from my side of the wall. This is a structural issue which I doubt they can address now.\n\nBathroom\u002FShower area is spacious and you get fast HOT water in the shower.  No issue with this area.  2 people could fit in the shower and in the bathroom but it will be a bit tight.  \n\nLights in the room are lacking brightness but the window (natural light) makes up for it.  Just enough outlets on the lamps for phone charging.\n\nOverall similar to a holiday inn room but the few plus (mattress, hot water fast) beat the HI for the room.  I'll have to give this brand a few more tries to see if I like them more then HI.  Overall I was impressed with them for my 1st visit.",5,positive

The only problem I had was upon check-in. I had just arrived around 5:30pm from the air port after a long trip from California, they had my reservation which I had made months in advance through the APA travel agency. When I presented my company credit card to pay for the room I was told they could not accept the card because my name was not on it. I was tired from the long day of traveling on planes and I was hungry as well so I became very agitated and angry. I was told it was the hotels policy that they can only accept credit cards with the persons name on it, my travel card has my company name on it. I told the clerk this is the same credit card that pre-paid the first night, I told them this was ridiculous and that I had never had this problem before. I was told I could present another credit card with my name on, pay cash,  or have my company fill out a credit authorization form. After raising some stink the manager said they would accept my company credit card. They said they have had a lot of fraudulent credit cards and had to go to this policy. My advice to those traveling on business and intending to stay here make sure your company submits a credit authorization form if you are traveling with a P-card with just the company name, this hotel will not accept a credit card without your name on it. I had no trouble with this credit card at the restaurants I dined at. After I check-in and went to my room I found a really nice room with a comfortable bed and flat screen TV, The hotel was very close to the convention center and the breakfasts each day were very good. I felt bad for making such a scene when I check-in I went and apologized to the very nice young adults that were manning the front desk. They handled my anger with professionalism and calm, I was very impressed. The person who handled the breakfast in the morning was very friendly. It was a good six day stay and I had a good nights sleep each night. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone with business at the convention center or on vacation.

I was blocked in by 3 other vehicles who illegally parked along side, front, and back of me. Check in was wonderful, room was wonderful. I'm not a breakfast person, but their breakfast was pretty darn good. You had your choice of biscuit, sausage, grave, scrambled eggs, yogurt, ceral, make yourself pancake machine, juice, tea, as well as all the condiments you could possibly need. Who knew lemon juice came in little packets. The area was clean, you had the workers standing by to replenish and clean the area. Nice size TV so you could eat and watch at the same time. How could I forget - I wish I had taking a picture of the lobby, there is an area off to the side  where the windows allowed you to see the convention center kitty corner to the hotel, as well as people watch. There was a fireplace, pillars, flat screen tv. It was as though I was in someone's family room. Never got to enjoy it, but looked very nice. Be careful of parking. Its really tight for a mini van, it took some maneuvering to get in the parking spot. I'm sure when they built the place we weren't driving these monstrosities. The staff was wonderful and so informative. No sales tax on clothing - Awesome!",5,positive

If the parking spaces are taken, you will need to park across the street in the parking garage.\n\nHoliday Inn will charge you $15 a night to park your car in their lot. This hotel was running a special for the Twin Cities Auto Show. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a suite, which was nice. We stayed in room 224, pictures supplied. The room was a little out dated but we where there for two nights and wasn't there too look at the decor. The jets in the whirlpool where a little low key and could have been better.\n\nThe fake plant was so dusty in the room, I'm surprised the leaves could stand up straight. I feel the staff could throw away the dusty plant. \n\nThe hotel does have a pool but we didn't use it. When you pull up to the hotel, only two cars can fit in the space in front of the hotel. The only way to get into the parking lot is to use a call box which dials to the front desk. They will ask for your name and parking space number and the gate well open.

As I entered I was greeted very professionally by the staff. Check in was great and very fast. I was in room 525 and let me tell you how amazed I was when I walked into the room. It was well decorated, the bathroom was huge, the bed was so comfortable, the linens and comforter were outstanding, nice Nespresso machine in the room too. Also fully stocked bar. Room service was great, went down to the bar for a few drinks. Bartender was very friendly and sociable. Not too overly priced either. Good selection of beer, food, wine, and spirits. One thing that I gotta say is I loved the bath towels they were the best I have ever felt. I wish they sold them cause I would love some for my own house. Bathroom was stocked full of premium soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, qtips, cotton balls, big eye mirror for my fiance, hair dryer plus many more amenities! Had one problem with room service in the morning, they sent up the wrong eggs but when I called up to let them know, they quickly apologized and sent up the correct eggs. Ordering room service was kind of tricky had to do it via the smart TV. Check out was kind of slow only had one person behind the desk and there were quite a few people in line. But after a bit another person showed up to assist. The one big surprise was that I had to pay $45 to park. I would have thought the parking would have been covered or validated. Paying for parking was a big wake up call. Otherwise I have nothing negative to say about it here. It was well beyond clean, comfortable, reputable, and very relaxing.

The InterContinental had both! \n\nReserving the meeting room was easy peasy as I dealt directly with the catering sales manager at the hotel who was super responsive and accommodating. After some quick e-mails and chats on the phone, I had everything set for a successful meeting.\n\nStill, I'd never been to the hotel before and had no idea what to expect, which is sometimes a great place to start.\n\nThe hotel itself is easy to get to--IF you're flying into Terminal 1. I was coming from Terminal 2 so feel MSP could have better directions on getting to the hotel. Seemed like some of the information kiosk folks didn't know the hotel was connected to the airport at all. Took me a bit to find my way over to the hotel.\n\nThat said, I crossed over to the hotel and was immediately impressed with the the facade and more so by the interior. Finding the meeting space on the 2nd floor was simple and the meeting space was just big enough for the 4 people, plus we had access to the wall-mounted big screen TV for our presentation.\n\nWhen the meeting concluded, we all went down to the bar, which was a lot like walking into a French bistro for some beer. But a lot better, because there was a great selection of micro-brews. Once the client had left, the remainder of the team stayed on to play pool, enjoy appetizers, and wander the small but welcoming lobby area. The Bradstreet Crafthouse presents a solid set of appetizers and I personally recommend the lobster roll!\n\nRoom looked out over runway and was certainly large enough for one person and had an impressive bathroom.

We had a super early flight and an  impending snow storm affecting our travel time from Wisconsin,  as a precaution we decided to make reservations at this hotel,  which we understood to be connected to the airport. We left our vehicle at a parking structure who then shuttled us to the airport, where we understood there would be a hotel shuttle. We couldn't find the shuttle and we attempted to call the hotel several times without getting a response.  The on a septuple shuttle waiting time and difficulty reaching the front desk is something we also read in a couple of reviews. We finally reached somebody who told us there should be a Mercedes Benz black shuttle waiting, we walked up-and-down and once again there was nothing. She then told us that there should be one arriving soon, in all it took about 25 minutes for us to be picked up.  Our shuttle driver was very courteous and friendly,  we made a super short drive to the hotel but we ensured to tip him. There were only 2 agents at the front desk and several of us waiting to checking in, it took a bit of time as well, but they were friendly, informative and we soon made our way to our upgraded room with city view, which turned out to be the view of a big structure and construction areas but no biggie, by then it was late and we needed to get to bed, which brings me to the biggest negative. We read on a couple reviews about the beds being  being very firm,  we didn't worry about it because would both do not like soft beds, but these beds have to be the hardest beds we have ever encountered and we travel frequently. It felt as if sleeping on the box spring  rather than the mattress. We even looked to see if perhaps the beds were air adjustable beds and we somehow missed the memo. Our teenaged child that was with us, can sleep on anything and the next morning  complained of a sore back before we even commented how tired and achy we were ourselves.  To top it all off, the bedding itself what stiff and noisy, it felt as if we were sleeping in parchment paper,  it reminded us of overly starched material. The room itself was very clean, very modern, very much with an upscale  vibe, a mini bar and a big window facing a parking structure.  The bathroom was huge, amenities available, double sink, definitely impressive.  Overall it was quiet,  there was nothing besides the beds that kept us from getting a restful sleep.  The front desk agents informed us that we could make reservations for a shuttle the next morning, together with another couple we need it to be picked up very, very early in the morning  and so we made reservations upon check in,  which was very convenient.  The shuttle arrived on time the next morning, we loaded up, it turned out there were 4 other people and it  was a full shuttle. Our driver asked as he began to pull away from the curve about the different airlines. Those on the 1st row said United and 2 rows said Delta. The driver apparently didn't hear because he stated that  everybody is United, we repeated we were Delta a little bit louder and he just grunted.  Again, after a very short drive, he pulled up to the curb said it was the United check in  area and very flippantly mentioned for the others  Delta was somewhere near and with that he got out of the shuttle and started at pulling out luggage.  Fortunately we're  very familiar with this airport but the couple behind us was not and asked us if we knew were to go as we also mentioned we were flying Delta as we departed the hotel. We reassured them that the check in areas were close and just to follow us,  that it was his flip comment that made it sound as if he was just dropping us at a different airline's check in point and we were on our own to find the Delta counters.  Overall,  we won't go out of our way again to stay at this hotel, there are other options with more comfortable bed and less hassle,  as far as the  city view upgrade,  as another review mentioned, I would be really careful before selecting it,  the picture is a bit blurry but you can clearly see that what we're looking at is a big structure in the midst of construction  with a less than minimal city skyline view. The convenience factor it's not there enough for us.  Read the website carefully before booking, it does indicate that the concourse connections\u002Fwalkways hours are limited and  before 5:30 a.m. the TSA checkpoint is not available. Another guest mentioned he did not read enough to understand that the TSA checkpoint is for carry on luggage only, had to take a shuttle back to the airport to check his luggage, back to the hotel just to find out the TSA checkpoint wouldn't be open anyway. Again it's nothing that the hotel can control but is a convenience that is really not a wide convenience, it is dependent on your flight and luggage  situation.  Bottom line, know before you book.",3,negative

I was told at check-in that I had to pre-book a seat on the shuttle van for the next morning. The van seats less than a dozen people and only runs every 20 minutes, so it is constantly full. It takes you to an entrance to the airport that is far from the departure gates and has poor signage. If you got to the hotel through the direct hotel entrance by the C gates (as I did) and you aren't used to this airport (as with most people stuck there overnight on weather delays), then you won't know where this entrance is, and you will be confused when you are trying to make your flight. Security lines at MSP are long and far apart.\n\nThe hotel obviously can't do anything about the TSA, but there are things it can do and, unacceptably, isn't doing. First of all, the top text on the hotel's website screams \""IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO TERMINAL 1 THROUGH TSA CHECKPOINT AT GATE C25.\"" Um, no. Someone should have fixed this weeks ago. Second, it should at least double the frequency of the shuttle and\u002For get a larger capacity vehicle. Third, it is not enough to post signs in the lobby apologizing for the lack of TSA checkpoint: the hotel should give out printed information about how to get to the departure gates from the entrance to the airport that the shuttle takes you to, because passengers won't know this entrance and the signage there is so bad. It should send this info in emails to guests as they check in, or text them a link to a web page, or whatever. \n\nHaving said that, it's a very nice hotel with stylish rooms, high-tech TVs with built-in Chromecast so you can stream TV\u002Fmovies\u002FYouTube from your Android phone, nice beds, a decent gym (though no stationary bikes :-( ), etc. Food and service at the restaurant were surprisingly good. \n\nThe lack of care and attention during the TSA outage bespeaks management that doesn't have its eye on the ball, though.",4,positive

You don't get this on the south side, but you will see buildings that Bloomington has to offer and this side gets larger jets taking off right in front of you, so it's got that going for it. By the way, there is little sound from the jets. Double windows see to that.\n\nI ate dinner and breakfast there. Both were very good and the Brewhouse has a good selection of beer. Absolutely no complaints.\n\nI've stayed at many hotels around MSP, but the InterContinental is my new go-to. Price wise, it's about the same as the nicer hotels along 494, but they don't offer the convenience of being just a two or three minute shuttle to the airport or a short walk to Concourse C.",5,positive

The hotel was nice and next door to the airport.  The room and beds were awesome.  Comfortable and clean.  Check in was a breeze.  The only thing I think they could have made clearer on their website and at check in is that if you have to pick up luggage at the airport you cannot just walk through the airport to the hotel.  You have to take a shuttle.  Granted it was quick, but the website makes it sound like you can get your bags and just walk straight through the airport to the hotel.  That is not the case.  Starting at 5am they have a TSA gate you can walk from the hotel straight to gate C25, however, that is only if you have carry on bags only.  If you have to check bags, you need to shuttle over.  Again, they could be more clear on this issue.",4,positive

Cool eclectic vibe. Fun bar area. Great lighting in the room. Quality of breakfast items was great (more on that later). Awesome wet-bar\u002Fmini kitchen in the room!!!! With a fridge, sink, microwave and everything! (That was really cool. Seriously.). Everything was spic-and-span new. Nice quality amenities (shampoo, conditioner, etc). Really great shower.

Bright Pepto-Bismol pink spill or stain on the front where you can't miss it. Yuck. That kind of ruined the whole ambiance.\n2. The breakfast was really disappointing. It consisted of bagels and a few pastries, pouches of oatmeal, and coffee that was empty so we had to wait around for the carafe to be filled. No juice, no yogurt, etc. Pastries were really picked over so we had to wait for more to be brought out (although the quality was excellent). We were told breakfast was sparse because it was a \""budget hotel.\"" \nSome really small, nitpicky stuff-- we called down for more coffee and were told no one was available to run it up to the room, so we needed to run down to the front desk to get some. Those cool lights in the room? Batteries in the remote were dead (or maybe we just couldn't figure out how to work it between the 3 of us?) so we had to sleep with the purple lights on all night. We got the room with a sofabed, but the room was pretty crowded for 3 people (maybe it would work better for 2 adults and a child, but not 3 adults). Staff was awesome but probably could have used 1-2 more people to keep things moving more quickly, especially in the morning to help with check-out and to keep the breakfast bar stocked.\n\nAll in all, it was an okay stay. I think the place has potential and has a LOT going for it. I agree with one of the previous posters that said they need to make up their mind if they are a budget or upscale hotel. I was swayed by the great reviews and the fun pictures-- but I could have spent the same amount of money to stay at a higher end hotel where I get points\u002Fmiles (I usually stay at Hilton or Marriott) OR I could have spent $30 less to drive 5-10 miles and gotten a bigger room and a hot, more filling breakfast.",3,negative

I had very, very high expectations for this hotel after reading reviews and seeing the price. Overall, it was a nice place.  The hotel lobby and bar area were borderline cruise-ship gaudy. It was very bright and did have a modern feel, but for me--a little too much.  Our room, on the other hand, was nicely appointed with very modern d\u00E9cor.  Although perhaps a little too much furniture for the small room.  Our beds were amazingly comfortable.  And, the lights on the ceiling were a nice touch.  \n\nWhat did not meet my expectation?  The water pressure in the shower.  At a price of over $250 per night, I expect water pressure to blow me away. The water pressure in our shower was just short of pathetic.  It took over a half hour in the shower just to get rinsed.  I did speak to the front desk about this after our first night and they told me they'd have maintenance look at it.  When we returned that evening, they assured me the problem had been taken care of.  When we got to the room, there was some sort of shower part laying on the side of the tub so I'm assuming that they did do something.  But turning on the shower and testing the pressure was not something that they could have done.  So at 10:00 PM on night #2 there was much I could do except take another extremely long shower to get rinsed off.  No one at the front desk asked me about my stay or if the shower was fixed the next morning.  \n\nAnother thing to note was that the hotel did offer a very tiny version of a continental\u002Fgrab-and-go breakfast.  We were not expecting this, but it was somewhat convenient.  Although I might add that if they were going to do this they should either do it or not do it, not do it half way--which kind of felt like what they were doing.  We had to ask for the coffee to be refilled and the bagel\u002Fcream cheese selection was slim. Again, a nice thing to offer, but almost not worth their trouble.  \n\nOne last note...our hotel room did not have a real window. It had what looked like a window, but behind it was just lighting to resemble the outdoors.  Kind of weird and not something we were expecting. \n\nThe hotel was close to the metro line (just a short walk), so that was nice. \n\nOverall, I would have really enjoyed this if my water pressure had not been an issue.

Chose luMINN from reviews on Trivago and it exceeded our expectations. Friendly welcoming staff who were very helpful directing us around town also. Came from the airport for a buck offpeak on the Metro and short one block walk down 3rd ave from Government Center stop. Beautiful 3rd floor room with kitchenette, gorgeous marble tile bath, and sitting area. At first we were a little taken aback by no window but the lighting is more than adequate and the noise level nonexistent without the street near. Exercise room clean and well equipped. Grab and go breakfast more than met our needs and the dining area is clean, large, with multiple TVs to allow us to watch the US Open rather than Fox in the am. Easy access to the Skywalk for inclement weather. Not far to the river walk, pedestrian promenade, lots of restaurants and shops. We could not have been more pleased with our stay at a very reasonable price. I would go back in a heartbeat!",5,positive

We took a photo and contacted the manager a few days later and they argued the size and refused any compensation for our inadequate room (and yes, we had 6 people).  The sliding door to bathroom gets hung up on track and you get trapped in, needed assistance from someone else on other side to get open.  We called down for more bath towels to be delivered to our room before morning and they never came.  To top off, the complementary morning breakfast was completely wiped out when we got down there with plenty of time left before they shut down and only one person manning the checkout counter, valet keys and breakfast.

Honestly that's where the niceness ends for me, though. \n\nWhen we were checking in we learned parking was much more than what was originally stated. We were quoted at between 25 - 30 and it ended up being over 40. Ended up finding a parking ramp a couple blocks away for much cheaper. \n\nMy husband and I stayed several months ago back in July(2018) for a single night. The room we had was very..cozy..and had no windows. Again, had interesting lighting and modern interior design, but didn't feel very welcoming. That could definitely just be a personal preference of mine, but it wasn't particularly enjoyable. The hallways echoed everything very loudly and we could hear everything going on outside our room. The door did a very poor job at keeping noise out. Which was lovely when we were trying to sleep and drunk partiers were just getting back to their rooms. I have nothing against going out and having fun but I like not having to hear it when I'm trying to sleep. \n\nI would like to say that everything was very well kept and the staff were polite and friendly, I have absolutely nothing against them for this negative review. The real reason behind this negative review is what happened after the stay. My credit card was authorized for the cost of the room plus a standard hold which was to be expected. After a few days the hold came off and the authorization for the room charge remained. I figured that would be the end of it because the money wasn't available on my card with that authorization so I figured the charge was being processed. Come to find out that it was, in fact, never processed. Until today. Out of nowhere I get the charge for the hotel and it puts my account well overbalance, essentially screwing up my budget for the next couple months. I stayed July 7th, it is now October 10th, you do the math on that. \n\nI am extremely dissatisfied with service on that front. It should not take that long to process a single charge on a credit card. \n\nI'm writing this out as a warning to any future customers who might stay here. Just keep an eye on your charges and make sure it actually goes through in a timely manner. Don't end up like me.",2,negative

Upon entering the room we noticed the ceiling cove lighting was red giving the room a funky look.  Another oddity was there was no windows in the room...just a mock window which had lights behind the blinds made to look like a window...gave the room a claustrophobic feel.  The room and layout was very nice though.  It had a small kitchen with a refrigerator, cooktop, dish washer, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, cooking supplies, dishes, silverware, cups and glasses everything you would need to cook a meal.  There were 2 queen beds which were very comfortable.  A nice little seating area with a small sofa and ottoman, desk and chair.  A nice size closet with iron and board, could use a few more hangars.  The bathroom was spacious with nice amenities...shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soaps and shower cap.

Two moms and two school aged children, who knew we were not the target clientel for this brand, but we truly enjoyed out short stay here. Parents - wallpaper by the elevator is hands showing the middle finger, photo in our room also included the same hand gesture. Our girls 10 & 12 mentioned without prompting that they felt this was inappropriate, as they spent a lot of time in the awesome hammocks, they had plenty of time to contemplate the wallpaper.\n\nWe had some minor issues due to Marriott corporate that very seriously need to be addressed. I was initially tempted to leave only 4 stars, but the fabulous staff at this hotel made to best of the situation, earning back the 5th star.\n\nFirst of all, we booked a room for 4 that apparantly doesnt really exist. Another reviewer mentioned this so I called the hotel at booking just a few days before our stay and was told there was no such room and that they system shouldnt have let me book that room class, they advised me to call corporate, which I did. I was put on hold so the rep could call the property himself, he then came back on the line to assured me that yes, we would have a room for 4 with one queen and a bunk bed. The day of our arrival I received an email saying there was no room with queen bed and bunk bed, asking if two rooms would be ok, which it was, but why on earth did the corporate customer service actually lie to me about calling the property and confirming the bed configuration - as a Silver member I called the priority number - what kind of service is THAT, fake it til you make it?!  Shame on you, Marriott, I am extremely grateful the property staff was able to make it right for us after their corporate overlords had let us down.\n\nSecond of all, Marriott website says there is Valet parking, $25\u002Fday, no, not so, either on street parking or some nearby paid lots. Again, fine, but knowing that ahead of time would have been really useful, as we circled the property 3 times, which is actually a 3 block circle due to one ways, looking for a valet stand that didn't exist or a place to park because the 15 minute loading zone was full of cars that never moved all evening - very frustrating.  Then I walked all around the hotel looking for the hotel entrance because the doors had hand written signs that said something about \""ticketed event only\"" so it looked like a club entrance, not at all like a hotel entrance.\n\nOnce we got inside the hotel, the rest of our stay was fabulous. There was an event\u002F band in the bar when we arrived, very loud and we didn't stay down there with kids, but looked to be a good time with crowd of happy, friendly people.  All the staff was encountered were great. Rooms were wonderfully quirky, the common areas were super fun. We loved the furnishings in the rooms, loved all the hooks on the walls to store all the things, loved the European fixtures in the bathroom, loved playing the guitar, appreciated numerous outlets and USB ports. The furnishings were really nice, the leather headboard and leather luggage rack were especially classy, there were lots of lighting options and cool motion activated under bed \""nightlight\"". Blackout curtains on the windows good, but we did hear quite a bit of street noise, on the 5th floor, vehicle traffic and a noisy after hours crowd at 2:30am, ambiance?\n\nNow, this room is designed for really close friends - rooms are small and there is no privacy. There is seriously a window in the shower, and the bathroom door slides with no lock. Because of both the window and the gap under the door, if you turn on the bathroom light at night, you'll light the whole room. \n\nNo coffee making device so no cups in the room, make sure to bring a water bottle. Coffee by the bar was very good, good tea selection,  plus they had bagels and beverages for sale, and a toaster, microwave, and some condiments. Lots of great restaurants in this lively neighborhood.\n\nWe were up early, had breakfast off site, then enjoyed the hotel common areas as we had some time to kill before the 10am opening of Minneapolis Institute of Art, our kids playing foosball, while the adults were spinning some vintage vinyl over coffee.\n\nLong review, sorry, but in short, some issues with Marriott corporate, some other things I wished we'd known ahead of time, but all of us enjoyed our stay, and would return to this property.

There is a lot to like about the new Moxy, but there is a lot to dislike if you are used to certain amenities.  Apparently, young millennials do not care  the same things as us older folks.\n\nThe positive things are the location and the design of the place.  It has a fun, vibrant aura about it.  The lobby is like one giant play room.  The hallway leading to your room are clean, sleek and the inside of the rooms have giant windows with minimal, but really fun d\u00E9cor.  ts location in Uptown allows you walkability to the restaurants and bars nearby and the lake.\n\nNow the downsides.  We got \u201Cupgraded\u201D to a sixth floor (top) city view room and I have never had a worse night\u2019s sleep in my life.  The street noise is horrendous through most of the night.  The noise between the rooms is bad as well.  We both had \u201Cwhite noise\u201D playing from our phones but nothing helped.  The room itself had nowhere to really hang your clothes properly (no wardrobe or closets).  There were plenty of coat hooks and a few hangers but you will be living out of your suitcase for the most part.  There is no coffee maker, refrigerator or mini-bar which is all fine if you know that ahead of time.  They offer free coffee in the morning down in the lobby.  It is just not as convenient.  They offer larger soap, shampoo and conditioner in stationary pump bottles but no lotion.  There are also no eating options at the hotel, but plenty nearby.  Lastly, there is absolutely no parking if you have a rental car.  Don\u2019t be fooled by the claim to that they have limited parking for free.  While there are about 5 \u2013 6 spots behind the hotel, they were always full.  There was not really even a place to park temporarily to check in.  Parking options do exist however.  Nearby you can pay to park in the garage at Calhoun Square or if you find a spot in the abandoned lot across the street or on one of the streets that have free parking and are not permitted.  Again, not a big deal and manageable if you know these things upfront.  Perhaps our fault for not reading about the hotel more before we stayed.\n\nAt the end of it, we loved the look and feel of the hotel and the energy of it.  The staff were really friendly.

They obviously did not care whatsoever. The 4th time, they didn't even answer at all. I even tried calling from my cell instead of the hotel phone with no answer. The hotel phone can literally read you a kitschy bedtime story, but cannot actually contact the front desk when you need it.\n\nTHEN, They tried to charge my card for $200 for smoking. Even after telling the manager, we are far too respectful to ever think about smoking in any Marriott as I have been staying at Marriotts for over 15 years. He went on to yell at me, it didn't matter even if we did or did not smoke that they would charge my card simply because they could whether I like it or not. He proceeded to hang up on me. I am not a complainer or a confrontational person. I never expected to be treated instantaneously like I am a monster from the moment I spoke to the manager. I called back and was immediately transferred to a different person. I told her about the situation as I was on the edge of tears after being berated by the previous manager. She was much more kind and understanding and said they would not try to charge my card again. Still a horrible situation to go through.\n\nI booked this hotel looking at those dreamy photos, thinking of all the cool Instagram photos I could take. I was SO excited to stay. Now, I feel like I deserve a full refund plus compensation for inconvenience and harassment. Yeah, I'm sure that will never happen.

I found illegal parking and used that long enough to check in and drop my bag before moving my car.  The person who checked me in made no mention of the fact that the valet was nowhere to be seen.  She explained the property to me as \u201Cmusic and bar oriented\u201D, which was good and what I expected.  The lobby\u002Fbar area was quiet, but it was a Wednesday night so I guess that was not unusual.\nThe room was tiny was well appointed and designed.  No closet but a lot of hooks and hangers on the wall, which was a good use of the limited space.  The bathroom was also very small but actually nice, with a great shower and enough shelf\u002Fholder space for all my stuff.  The room included a guitar and amp (I don\u2019t play, but a nice touch and solid \u201Cbranding\u201D), a folding table which worked well for work and eating but stayed out of the way when not in use, and luggage rack.  There was also a clothes steamer instead of an iron and ironing board, which I liked a lot.  There was an ironing station on the floor if needed.  The bed and pillows were comfortable enough.  The hotel listing mentioned that the in-room TVs were equipped with screen mirroring, but that was not the case which was disappointing.  Also, two of the six USB ports in the room did not work.\nThe exercise room was tiny, with only two treadmills, one bike and a punching bag and free weights.  If more than two guests want to work out at a time, it would have been an issue.\nThe biggest disappointment was in the lobby area, and in the places where the hotel concept should have, but did not shine.  Upon arrival I was given a guitar pick that could be exchanged for a free drink.  On two separate occasions when I tried to use it, I was asked to wait as the bartender was not available (both times were late afternoon).  In once case, with no bartender insight I ended up having to buy a Perrier from the cooler instead of waiting for who-knows-how-long.  The hotel desk is connected to the bar and why the desk person couldn\u2019t pour me my requested club soda I am not sure, but they were able to ring up my purchase!\nAlso in the lobby area was the vinyl listening lounge.  First, when I asked for headphones to use the listening area, one employee told me that they didn\u2019t have any.  I asked someone else later that day and they were able to give me a pair to use.  I went into the listening area and found the selection of albums available to me mostly late 70s\u002Fearly 80s stuff.  It worked for me but it was limited in genre to say the least.  Once I picked up a couple of albums to listen to, I found only one of the three turntables was actually able to play the disks they had available.  Also, the two comfortable chairs were too far away from the turntables to actually sit in while listening.  This are, about 1\u002F3 of the lobby and a major part of the experience advertised by the hotel, was completely worthless.\nFor a hotel where the staff happily tells you that the property is \u201Cmusic and bar oriented\u201D, the hotel really delivered on neither.

I was not aware that there was not a dresser, closet, or desk in the room! Also, the shower does not have a door, and it got cold in there. The television was unhooked from the power source which I had to fidget around with to get it to work. Not exactly a ideal after a long day of travel.\n\nMy second night's stay was more favorable. I was well rested from the night before. The beds were comfortable and clean. The blankets were thin and there were no extra in the room but I managed.

There are record players and vinyls available to listen to so that was kind of unique.  We paid extra for a king room with a view.  We did have a view, but the room itself was still pretty small.  I like that they had a pegboard along the wall where a table and the fold-out luggage stand could be hung on the wall to save space, but once you had those items out and unfolded you almost couldn't move in the room because it was so small.  In addition, I'm not sure how often the bedding is cleaned; I removed it and got my own out of my vehicle because there was a brown crusty stain on the sheets... not sure if it was food or what but I wasn't really willing to risk it.  Parking sucked, there isn't any at the facility and you pay $12 to park in an open, unsecured lot across the street, although valet was available we just didn't opt for it.  The biggest issue I really had was that the room we were in was on the 6th floor and we could still hear the music playing on the 1st floor, and the traffic noise was really loud and kept us awake for a lot of the night. The bed was comfortable, and I did think it was really cute that in the bathrooms instead of giving you mini shampoos and conditioners there are larger bottles affixed to the shower so you can't take the whole bottle, but there is a pump so you can take as much as you need.  Thought that was a nice touch and I appreciate their attempt at being a little more green than most hotels... but I'd really like it if I'd had clean sheets, that was a huge bummer.  There was also a guitar and amp in our room, and there was actually a cable that I think you could actually plug in and play... this was part of the reason I got this room, I thought my husband would really enjoy it, but the guitar had a lot of broken strings so it was unplayable.

This is a new hotel with all the modern features.  Having Alexa in the room is a very nice touch.  Complimentary water is also a nice gesture. \n\nOverall layout of the room is nice.  Decorations are well adorned.  There are plenty of outlets to charge phones, and there is also a USB charging station located underneath the couch.  Room darkening shades are very nice as they go wall to wall so there is light leakage.  \n\nRooms are quiet.  Doors slam loud which is the only thing you can hear from the hallway.  \n\nThey supposedly offer you a free beer when you check in, which I was not.  Little disappointed that I nor my wife were asked.\n\nAs far as check in, I really am taken back by the fact that the receptionists are sitting on a chair behind a desk.  This is a luxury hotel and they should be standing at a nice check in counter, not a desk hidden under the stairs, nor should they be sitting down.  It almost had a feeling like you were checking out a library book.  \n\nBeds are soft and comfortable.  The bedding is rough, felt like fine sand paper.  The soft pillows and bed made it bearable.  \n\nThe HVAC system in the room is horrible.  It gets very hot and very dry.  Tried several times to lower the temperature but it stayed or increased on it's own.  Had to get up several times during the night to adjust it back down only to see that it went up 3-4 degrees on it's own.  As such, I had to rate my sleep quality only 2 stars due to this. \n\nOverall, this is a very nice hotel and I will be coming back here.  Not perfect, there are areas to improve, but worthy of 5 stars for sure. \n\nPS. Hotel parking... well, here's a tip.  First, if you want valet you will pay $44 plus your tip.  So plan on $50.  If you drove to the hotel, you surely can avoid the valet and park in the heated underground parking ramp for only $18.  It's just around the corner and very easy to find.  It's where valet is going to park your car anyways.  Take the elevator up and you're in the lobby.  I normally valet because there are not a lot of parking options.  $44 is comparable to another luxury hotel and quite frankly this is way over priced.",5,positive

We arrived and the electricity in the entire hotel was out (had been for hours) and didn\u2019t come back on until late that night. We had traveled over 8 hours that day, using our phones on the plane, to get ubers, take pictures, etc. so we had very low batteries and needed to charge the phone before we went out for the afternoon and night. As everyone knows, we use phones for our camera, texting, Uber, etc. it\u2019s very important to have some batteries before going out in a new city.  I guess we weren\u2019t going to wash our hair or use any device to get ready. No could do. The main problem we had since it really wasn\u2019t the hotel\u2019s fault about the electricity, was the LACK of sympathy or any sort of empathy toward this situation. Only I\u2019m sorry came out of a few employees. There was NO compensation given. A drink voucher, food voucher, just something would\u2019ve been sufficient to smooth over the situation. \nAfter returning from a long night we wanted a drink at the bar. The bartender had mysteriously disappeared and a nice server, Huey, was helping all the customers. He was awesome and recommend wine, but that\u2019s not even his job.  \nNext morning the coffee in the lobby was out for a long time. When I finally asked about it the front desk lady just said it should be here so I guess just wait a few minutes. We gave up, went back to the room and made coffee with our room Keurig machine.  \nBreakfast the next day was soooooo slow.  The manager was a slow moving unhelpful person. The hostess would disappear and leave people waiting. \nEvery employee we came across was not friendly or helpful except for Huey and the Saturday night bartender. It was like they never worked with the public before. They need to be retrained. I worked in restaurants for over 10 years and knows it starts with the management! \nThe room is actually the best part of the hotel. Room and bathroom both spacious. Decor is great. No suitcase rack though so we used the ottoman. Mini fridge was stocked. The coffee maker is good along with Alexa if you like that sort of thing. Bed was horrible though and sunk in the middle. No excuse for a new hotel. The hotel does have a nice lobby with fireplace and area to work or read. We didn\u2019t check out the gym or conference area. Elevator s were fast too. \nLocation is only decent if you\u2019re interested in the Vikings game (which we were so why we stayed) but the rest of the trip it wasn\u2019t good. Not super close to any other good restaurants, bars (besides the nice brewery next door) or even a good coffee shop. It\u2019s not super far but when I think of a downtown hotel, I like to step outside and have a ton of options within a few minutes of walking.

The bed is comfortable. Though the blankets are thin.\n\nWhat did not go well\n1. Check in experience\nI parked at the valet and after not seeing a valet or any staff for several minutes, walked into the hotel, grabbed a luggage rack, and proceeded to load all my luggage and wheel it in to the registration. For $500 a night, I would expect a valet to be on duty, and for someone to have shown up to assist.\n\n2. Breakfast\nWe pre-ordered breakfast for 8:15am. We had a 9am appointment and wanted to ensure we had enough time to eat and head out the door. At 8:25am it had not arrived. I called to ask and they said it was on its way. At 8:35am it had not arrived. I called again. They assured me it was on its way and proactively offered to discount the meal by 50%. A nice gesture.\n\nAt 8:40am, breakfast arrived. However they left out half of the order (my eggs and my wife's tea). I called and informed them that I didn't care about the eggs, but to send the tea right away. At 8:47am, they arrived with both my eggs and the tea, and informed me that the breakfast would be completely free.\n\nThis was just too little and much too late.\n\n3. Lack of basics\nMy wife had run out of make-up remover wipes. The room didn't have any, so I called down to ask if they had any. They informed that they were all out. We stayed at 5 different hotels over this trip, and all of them had make-up remover wipes in the room. \n\nWhen I asked if there was a drug store nearby that was open, she told me there wasn't. A quick search revealed a 24-hour walgreens, 5 minutes away. Again, basics.\n\n4. Loud\nWe were woken up by doors and stomping down the hall at least 6 times in the night between 1am and 4am. We travel with a Dohm sound machine and also had the in-room fan turned on. If you want a good night sleep, you shouldn't go to this hotel.\n\n5.

Devonte was super friendly; he made check-in smooth and painless. The hotel was freshly remodeled, very clean. Rooms were clean, loved the pillows. The bed was a Serta that seemed to have a softer top, but I can't confirm whether it was pillow top. It was softer than most hotel beds I've slept in, but still seemed to have a little firmness to it.

This hotel caters to business professionals, not specifically families, but that's what we were after (it was quiet). Hotel is an easy distance from U of M and Downtown, and while cheaper than most Downtown options, consider your itinerary and what transportation and\u002For parking needs you'll require. Parking fees vary but are most expensive during business hours or special events. Parking options include metered, above ground lots or ramps, or underground garages (just as an example, one on Marquette was $18 for a few hours).

Check Metro Transit website for your best options. There was one issue with a clogged sink, but maintenance was there fixing it within 5 minutes. So they are very attentive and accommodating. Entire staff we encountered was helpful: maid, maintenance, front desk. Free newspapers (USA Today and Wall Street Journal).

I was also told about the hours of the coffee bar located in the lobby and a parking area behind the hotel with more vacant spaces away from the restaurant parking in the front of the hotel.

The fridge apparently started a defrost and was leaking onto the carpet. I mentioned it to the front desk and she immediately contacted maintenance.

Nicely tiled shower with a rainfall showerhead and big sink in the restroom with a sliding door between the foyer\u002Fbathroom area and bedroom. Blackout curtains for the windows made it easy to sleep in past sunrise on our weekend stay.  Plenty of power and dedicated USB outlets for gadgets and devices. More than enough drawer and closet space for two adults for a weekend stay, and a four-digit programmable safe to secure electronics and other valuables when out and about.\n\nThe hotel restaurant has high ceilings and comfortable seating; high-top tables, dinner tables for two, four, and up to eight guests and even soft seating along some of the street-level windows with modern upholstered chairs and couches. Nicely lit space here which they have set up correctly and adjust nicely for the evening dinner service. Recommend the volcano-salt fries, lamb sliders, charcuterie, and pork belly small plates if you're in for cocktails. Kitchen serves a tasty grilled reuben sandwich with a sweet kimchee, and a lightly-battered walleye poorboy sandwich that are both exceptional.  And if you enjoy shellfish - absolutely try the excellent, excellent mussels.\n\nThis is a pet-friendly hotel.

Cool area of town in the Mill District.  Good restaurants and bars within walking distance.  About the hotel...Let's start with parking.  My company doesn't like to pay for valet so I pulled into the public garage 20 feet from the hotel's entrance that says, \""Hotel Guest Parking\"".  When I checked in, I was told that where I parked was NOT hotel parking but primarily for the restaurant Spaghetti Factory.  Overnight parking there was $60!  The hotel's only option was valet and it was a whopping $44\u002Fnight (to put this in perspective, valet at the Hilton Garden Inn downtown is $24).  I was told I could park across the street at the Fleet and Farm lot for $14\u002Fnight.  If you have a car - do that!  They were nice to have the valet bring me my car so I could park at Fleet and Farm.  Courtney and Jacoby were great at the front desk.  Hotel is in a refurbed lot and other reviews talk about the brick walls, wooden beams, high ceilings, etc.  Very environmentally conscious.  No free bottles of water, but \""hydration stations\"" on every floor (ice maker and filtered water).  I was also told that breakfast was above your standard hotel breakfast.  I don't know about above, but definitely different.  Buffet style.  First warming tray - oatmeal.  Fine for most, I'm a paleo guy who doesn't do much carbs or grains.  Next up hash browns.  Great for most, I'm not a potato guy.  Next - sausage!  Now we are talking!  Oops, spoke too soon.  It was vegan sausage.  Last on the hot line were \""French Scrambled Eggs\"".  I guess French means very, very softly scrambled.  Without breakfast meat, I was underwhelmed.  You might love it though.  Fitness center was a fitness closet.  But that is typical of most hotels.  The Hilton and Embassy Suites have huge gyms if that is your thing.  All in all, a unique hotel.  Best feature for me was the HUGE tv in the bedroom.  At least 65\"" if not 75\"".",4,positive

The beds weren\u2019t made nicely, and my Pajamas that I\u2019d folded and placed under a pillow, had been thrown on top of the bed instead of being back placed where I had left it. The rubbish had also been left in the room.  However maybe the housekeeping team were having a bad day. \n\nMe and my friend had a room which was facing the inside of the building, so our view looked down into the lobby instead of out into the city. So I\u2019d recommend asking when you\u2019re making your booking for a room facing out to the city instead of into the hotel if you prefer a room with a View. ",4,positive

The horizontal space was amazing.  There is a barn door between the sleeping portion is a nice option but the frosted glass does not block the light out.  Love the nightlight that glows with movement below the mirror to help guide you the bathroom in the middle of the night.  The shower was beautiful with the drain invisible.  Hotel provided large bath towels and there were 4 in the room instead of the standard 3.  ( I swear every hotel room usually has 3 towels!).

So all the huge wooden beams are exposed with accents of black metal.  This includes the rooms!  The meetings rooms downstairs (floor -1 on the elevator button) are large and could easily accommodate our meeting.  The catering service was served at the proper temperatures.\n\nThe room is something else - high ceilings, a bit of an industrial feel with a large window.

data/ca/43323/14985419/703020274.html,Canopy by Hilton Minneapolis Mill District,"""This was an excellent find! It had been a few years since I lasted visited the Twin Cities, and I was excited to see what was new in the hotel scene. I scoped out a couple boutique hotels that piqued my interest, but their prices (and a few negative reviews) were giving me hesitation. Enter Canopy, which was at the perfect price and location. \n\nReserving a room was a little confusing- I couldn't figure out the differences between the different rooms. What is the difference between 1 King Bed, 1 King Bed Deluxe, and 1 King Bed Lofted Ceiling w City View? The two photos for each on the Hilton website weren't helpful at all. \n\nI took a gamble and reserved the Lofted Ceiling w City View and was rewarded with a beautiful room that was comfortably appointed, with an industrial touch in the exposed brick wall and ceiling beams. I loved the layers of patterns and textures between the bed spread\u002Fpillows, and rug. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were huge and fluffy, perfect for sinking into. The room was also complete thoughtful finishes that I haven't really seen in many other hotels. From the small shelf by the front door for putting important things, to the cubby next to the bathroom sink for storing various toiletries off the vanity, to the small bench in the shower perfect for shaving legs. A refrigerator drawer built into the beverage cabinet (that also had a carafe for filtered water refills) was very handy. \n\nMost of all I liked the luggage \""station\"", for lack of a better term, where you could lay out your luggage to unpack, hang clothes, iron, put away unmentionables in drawers, and store your shoes. This was located in the entry area, and was separated from the main bedroom by a sliding door.\n\nPlenty of outlets were also easily accessible all throughout the room. If I had only one complaint about our room, it would be that it was a touch dark at night due to the high ceilings. \n\nOur room also had a fun view of the city, and a window way up high to let in daylight. \n\nAll of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. \n\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay and would not hesitate to return. The only thing left to mention is the valet parking fees, which are a staggering $44 a night. My husband and I spend a lot of time in Denver for medical reasons, staying at various properties throughout downtown, and this fee is in par with the Four Seasons. I know that Minneapolis isn't Denver, but I'm not sure what justifies this insane fee. I have a feeling the proximity to the stadium might have something to do with it. We parked in the parking garage across the street for our first evening for $14, but then their rates went up to $50 due to a game the next day, so we used the valet services for one evening. It was fine. But I really think this fee should be lowered to $25-$30 a night, which wouldn't have made us think twice to use it.",5,positive

I stepped on it with my bare foot. \n\nI called the front desk and told them and they said they'd send up housekeeping. 15 minutes later I had to go to my conference and they still hadn't sent anyone. No one called me or apologized throughout the day.\n\nIn the evening I checked in with the assistant manager and she was very apologetic, and confirmed the room had been cleaned but that they hadn't cleaned the carpet. I asked for a room change and she moved me to another room. In that room there was also stuff left over from a previous guest (just a hair clip this time...but still...)\n\nThe assistant manager offered a refund, or points for a stay for one night at another Hilton. She said a refund would be difficult because I booked through Hotels.com, but they could do it. I said I would let her know later. After my stay I decided I didn't want the points because I would not stay in a Hilton again, and I requested the refund through Hilton. They wrote and said they couldn't do it because of the third party booking. I asked them to check in with the front desk but they did not and just said I should take it up with Hotels.com.\n\nThis is the worst hotel experience and customer service I've personally experienced. I 1000% would not recommend this hotel. I have a toddler daughter and shudder to think what could have happened if she was in the room and got hold of the condom. \n\nAs a side note, the hotel walls are really thin and I could hear the people next to me speaking normally.

data/ca/43323/14994536/677681276.html,Stay Alfred on 2nd Street,"""Unlike the other review.  My 1 bedroom apartment (#514) was clean and comfortable.  The toilet paper roll in the bathroom was a bit wonky but no mold.  A couple of scuff marks, but no dirt.  Because there aren't many reviews, I will try and be thorough.  First, this is an apartment in an apartment building.  There is no reception, concierge, parking.  You must download the app in order to get the codes to get through the front door and retrieve your key from a 'locker'.  The app walks you through the process effectively, but I can imagine points where it can go wrong, particularly if you aren't comfortable with technology.  The key is actually a fob, which you must return to the 'locker' when you depart.  My room overlooked the side alley and although it had a small balcony, the noise from a mechanical unit below was loud.  Luckily, I couldn't hear it from inside the unit.  The kitchen, properly sized for an apartment of this size, had pots, pans, dishes, and glasses.  There were a few dishwasher tablets, you are expected to fill and turn on the dishwasher before you depart.  There is a stacked washer\u002Fdryer in the apartment which I used.  The bedroom is not large, but, the closet is.  (you may want to bring your own hangers, since you won't be able to call housekeeping to ask for more).  There is no daily bed making or towel changes.  I believe they do have a service but I wasn't there long enough.  There is no door guard.  There is a no noise after 9:00 pm rule and the weekday nights I stayed the building was quiet.  I could hear footsteps from the apartment above but it didn't bother me.  There was only one tv remote for the cable box, which I found odd since there were two tvs..  There were two remotes to turn on the tv. Wifi was free and there was a password.  There is a nice sized gym in the building.  The building is a short walk to Whole Foods, Starbucks, restaurants, shops, and public transportation.  Although there is no parking, there are numerous lots around the area.  The riverfront walkway is a short walk away.  The few residents\u002Fguests I ran into were cordial.  Overall, I think this is a great option for the price.  I would stay here again.",4,positive

I'm not super-picky and consider myself to be a pretty reasonable traveler. I decided to try Stay Alfred for a weekend leisure trip with my husband. What a joke.\n\nFirst, the apartment needs to be CLEANED! The walls were the worst part- absolutely filthy! There were many pretty gross stains on the carpet and there was actually french fries in one of the displays. Ick! The shower curtain was at least a foot too long and so was wet the entire time. The shower itself barely got warm enough to take a shower and the water pressure was terrible. The cabinets had fingerprints and grease all over them. \n\nThe check-in process started with them texting us the WRONG address~ the actual apartment was across the street (not a great start to our trip.) The key-pad on the check-in kiosk was going bad so, after I waited for the poor guy ahead of me to finally get his key, it took me forever to get my code in. Once we finally got checked in, the hallway outside of our apartment had a pile of coffee grounds on it (which stayed there all weekend) and the apartment, ugh, was so dirty! If I would have been in a hotel, I would have insisted on changing rooms, but here I was, with NO front desk or staff, just an 800 number to call and now late for our dinner reservation. Our room description had said that we would have a beautiful rooftop area with BBQ grills and fireplaces and a fitness center and all kinds of lounging areas- NOTHING anywhere that we could find and absolutely no information at all in the apartment. Guess what? When we left, we discovered that it was actually in the building ACROSS THE STREET where they had originally said that our apartment was. And those amenities were, in fact, lovely! But since we weren't ever told that they were ACROSS THE STREET IN ANOTHER BUILDING, we didn't have a chance to use them- we didn't even see them until we were leaving and that was purely by chance. Check-out was equally frustrating, as the keypad was still not working properly. At some point during our stay, Stay Alfred updated their website! Oh yay, now we couldn't even get into the system since, when we made our reservation, WE DIDN'T  NEED A PASSWORD, we only needed our name and reservation number. Upon check-out, we got a chatty little text from \""Kelsie at Stay Alfred!\"" saying they had sent us an email with a survey. Of course, I didn't get it so I texted back to tell them. Guess what? Still no survey. Today I actually emailed them again to tell them I hadn't gotten a survey. Still  nothing. Did I mention that the apartment is across from The Armory, which is an almost 10,000 person concert venue? And they have events almost every weekend? And that there was a rapper named Juice Wrld there on Saturday night? And that it shook our entire apartment building? That there were sirens and police cars coming and going for hours? Yes, I guess I should mention that.... *sigh* if you were actually attending a concert at The Armory, or going to a Vikings game, the location is good. Otherwise, don't bother.",2,negative

Like the others, it provides convenient, comfortable short stay accommodations as an alternate to using a hotel.

The Skyway is a short walk across the street. The light rail is a few blocks away and easily walkable.

It proved to also be close to public transportation and, if you are willing to go for a decent walk, many points of interest and shops.\n\nThe check-in\u002Fcheckout process is all automated. You do not deal with any people directly, which is great if you like that kind of thing. Information is emailed to you with easy to follow instructions on how get\u002Freturn your \u201Ckey\u201D, which is actually a fob, that gets you into the building and your suite. The customer service chat agent on their website was very good at answering any questions you may have.\n\nThe apartment itself is very modern and functional. Ours had a full kitchen with more cupboards than you could possibly need. There is also no shortage of electrical outlets. I counted at least a dozen that were available. The bed was very comfy and made for several great night\u2019s sleep. There\u2019s also an in-suite washer and dryer for your use.\n\nSpeaking of which, the laundry room in our suite had part of the ceiling removed due to a washer malfunction in the suite above us. We were informed by the maintenance person that they were in the midst of repairing it and had advised the company not to rent this suite until the repair was completed, but somehow this was missed and we got it anyway. On our second last day the repair was carried out taking over four hours. It prevented us from using the washroom to wash up so we could leave and were stuck there while this all went on. In hindsight, we could have asked to do this before they started, but were still groggy and not thinking straight. This was a fluke thing and not typical.\n\nThere were a few minor things I noticed that aren\u2019t that big of a deal, but would be nice if they were addressed.\n\n- Our suite had tiny coffee cups. If you are used to full-sized mugs or have big hands, you will find these tedious. I did.\n- Even though there was a dishwasher, there was no drying towel for anything you may have to hand wash.\n- There are two TVs in the suite and just about as many available channels. I\u2019m not sure if the weather played havoc with reception, but we basically had about three channels that were consistent. We were subjected to watching endless episodes of Law & Order or cheesy Lifetime movies on nights we stayed in.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our stay here.

I printed out my instructions, and took them along.  The address was different, then the building in which we were assigned an apartment. The picture shown is one of two buildings that this company owns and rents.  The one that was assigned to us was across the street.  The amenities, such as the fitness room, that are shown in pictures are in the building shown in the main photo. Did not see that we could have possibly called and got permission to check in early if the apt was ready, as we sat at Starbuck for two hours waiting until 3pm. Obtaining key (which there is only one that you get to open the doors) took less than a minute and we found our way to our apt very quickly. Locks to the doors are electronicaly operated with a disk type key and not a card with chip or magnetic stripe.  Once the deadbolt lock is deativated you have to turn the deadbolt, then use the handle below to open the door. Rooms are very spacious, full kitchen with basic needs such as utensils, cups, plates, cookware, coffemaker, and toaster.  I booked this apt more for its space and we did not cook while we stayed there. Apt had a washer, dryer, ironing board, and iron. Had a large walkin closet between king size bed and bathroom.  Rooms were very clean. Glad that our apt was on the first floor as my wife uses a scooter to get around, but had reservations when the door from the living room to the nice patio outside opened and the sidewalk and 3 lane street was there.  Apt was very well insulated, as people walking on the streets, traffic, and train whisltle (metro line is only one block away) did not bother us.  Lastly, this place was priced relatively close to what it would have cost to rent a hotel room with just two beds.  We did not miss not having a front desk, and did not need to call anyone. Check out was just as quick to drop key as instructed. We walked to a lot of places to eat and took the metro train to the Mall of America one day, and rode the metro bus to the Russian museum another day.

A couple of months ago, I made reservations at the Nicollet Island Inn on their website. We were quite thrilled at the availability and the rates we were offered.  We signed up for the Bed and Breakfast package.  We got confirmation and all was well.  48 hours before we were set to arrive, we got an email saying that the website wasn't working properly and that our rate was going to jump nearly 5 fold.  They offered a somewhat reduced rate but it was still out of line in our view.  The website does not appear to be working now to make reservations for this package.\nMy concern is that the downtown Minneapolis area is very full this time of year and it has been difficult to find replacement accommodations at this late date. We are forced to stay further away and still have limited choices.\nSo here's the kicker.  My wife called last night to get clarification on the new charges.  The person on staff said he didn't have any power in the situation and the manager wouldn't be back until Tuesday. He said we could cancel without charge.  I found new accommodations this morning and called to cancel at the Nicollet Inn.  I was told we were informed weeks ago about the price change.

There are less than 30 guest rooms, so the inn is very quaint, and despite its location in the heart of the city it seems a world apart. \n\nThe oldest part of Minneapolis, St. Anthony Main, is a short walk from the inn, and there are tons of parks with walking and biking trails in addition to the area bars and restaurants. There is a kiosk to rent bikes a block or two away. If a more urban adventure is what you're looking for, the bright lights of downtown skyscrapers are just across the river the other way. There are also museums and theaters close by.\n\nWe also had the Sunday brunch. It's a 5-course affair that has enough choices to appeal to most any appetite, except for maybe children.

The hotel itself was quite nice.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and courteous, and the room was clean and quiet.  I noticed that another recent guest commented on signs of age and wear, such as cracks in the bathroom vanity.  We noticed this as well, along with things such as the window trim in desperate need of repainting.  But I found these things to be minor, particularly for a hotel of this age and historic significance.  Frankly, if everything were perfect and sparkling and new - if they'd gutted the interior and just left the historic facade - I think it would lose a good deal of its charm.  For example, we noticed that the floor in our room sloped to one side; so much so, that there was a wood spacer under the chest of drawers to keep it level.  We found this quaint, and a little amusing - not at all annoying or irritating.\n\nThe hotel is just across the river from downtown, so the views are nice, and it is convenient to get just about anywhere you'd want to go.  If the restaurant isn't your choice (or you're staying more than one night and want to check out others), there are several within walking distance.  There's also a movie theatre, walking\u002Fbiking trails, the historic Stone Arch Bridge, etc. - all within easy walking distance.  We took advantage of this and enjoyed a nice morning walk before returning to the hotel restaurant for Sunday brunch.\n\nIn fact, the only real issue we had was with the bed.  It was so soft, it reminded me of a water bed.  And for two people with bad backs, that is not ideal.  In the in-room notebook containing information about the hotel, there were instructions for adjusting the firmness of a \""Sleep Number\"" adjustable bed, but the bed in our room was not such a bed.  My wife wondered why they would include instructions for something the room did not have.  My best guess was that the room was likely supposed to have an adjustable bed - and maybe even did at one time - but something had happened to it, so it had been (perhaps temporarily) replaced with a standard mattress.\n\nIn fairness to the hotel and its staff, we did not discuss the bed issue with them.  My wife suggested asking if they had another room available which might have, if not an adjustable bed, perhaps a firmer one, but we ultimately decided not to worry about it, as it was just one night.  That turned out to be a bad decision.  My wife awoke the following morning with such back pain that I spent a good deal of time massaging it before she got up.  A gentle massage from a loving spouse may seem quite romantic - particularly as it was our anniversary - but, believe me, when there's that level of pain involved, it tends to kill the romantic mood.\n\nAgain, though, I must stress that we did not discuss this with the staff.  Given how friendly and professional they were, I feel confident that they would have done anything in their power to address the situation, had we brought it to their attention.  We didn't, and that was our mistake.  I mention it, because, for any other travelers with back problems, it might be wise to discuss bed options when making reservations.

We talked about leaving after the first two courses but didn't know how to pull off a graceful exit so we stuck it out.   The desert was by far the best course and all of the wines very good.  Surprisingly the server never asked about the food quality when taking a plate with only a bite or two gone.  A waste of $300 on dinner (not including the room).  The hotel room was fine. There are a lot better hotels and restaurants in Minneapolis that cost the same or less.  We are willing to pay for a great experience but this one wasn't one of them.  We won't be going back.",2,negative

Without any clear five-star option in the city, a boutique inn seemed a nice change of pace.  Quaint location, high-end restaurant, it appeared to be my kind of place.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  \n\nI booked into a corner room with a soaking tub.  When I arrived, I found that the soaking tub was little more than a shower\u002Ftub combo suitable for a child to soak in.  Additionally, the room was particularly dark and dreary, with a completely unfunctional seating area consisting of a loveseat and end chair with no coffee table or place to enjoy a coffee, write, work, or simply relax.  The bed was uncomfortable and creaked, and the linens were stained.  Overall, being generous, a three-star hotel room with awful lighting and a terrible layout.  \n\nThe restaurant, unfortunately, was not much better.  Understaffed though not busy, the staff were more concerned with talking amongst themselves than providing some semblance of attentive service.  I frequently heard staff members gossiping about others (a massive service industry no-no) and using foul language in the process.  Hardly the atmosphere I envisioned when I booked the hotel.  \n\nI will say, though, good to very good food and good values in the restaurant for the quality.  Simply no atmosphere.\n\nI checked out after one night, very disappointed with the room and the restaurant.  For the rate, $229, I could have stayed at the W, Ivy, Chambers, and so on.  The Nicollet Island Inn makes no attempt whatsoever to be competitive in any way with these legitimate four-star properties.

The Inn is located on Nicollet Island, in the middle of downtown Minneapolis. It is very easy to access, just off Hennepin Ave. and there was plenty of parking. The building is a very charming former factory with ivy growing up the side. The entire premesis is a historic site which is very evident from the moment you walk inside. The interior is equally as charming with beautiful woodwork. Our room, located on the second floor was also beautiful with antique furnishings (old writing desk, lamps and armoir) and interesting shutters on the windows. The rest of the room, including the bathroom had a nice updated feel with flatscreen TV and an elegant wall covering. The bed was a sleepnumber and very comfortable. Overall I found the property to be a solid 4 out of 5 (with 5 being a very upscale resort...). \n\nWe stayed friday to saturday and only paid $200, which also included $30 at the restaurant downstairs (also woderful! Possibly the best eggs benedict I have ever had). I have stayed several places downtown Minneapolis and found this rate to be excellent. On the following morining, we walked around the area and found the neighborhood to be very pedestrian and bicycle friendly. Adjacent to the hotel is a 120 year old iron truss bridge that connects to the East bank. There are abundant walking and biking paths on both the island and the mainland river banks. We were fortunate enough to be there the same time as the Polish-American festival, which was going on about 2 blocks from the hotel. We are not Polish but still had fun listening to music, browsing vendors and eating some authentic Polish cuisine.\n\nI would recommend this hotel for couples and adults staying in the area. It did not have a pool or other child friendly ammenities. Other things to note: the rooms are keyed (as opposed to magnetic cards), there are no ice machines (too noisy so you must ask the front desk staff for ice) and the hotel has a very limited number of rooms (it is a botique hotel and not a large chain).",4,positive

She came back quickly to tell me that the room was already ready for us - it was just about noon and their usual check-in time is 3 p.m.!

Other notes about the room:  only one bathrobe (I let the wife use it); the floor slopes terribly (I measured it at 3%) and very noticeably; one of the windows in the room was broken and covered with a piece of plywood (that is a major NO NO in any hotel and should have been fixed the same day it was reported broken!). Avoid the packages sold with the room.  The package I bought included a credit at the restaurant and a bottle of champagne in the room.  The \""champagne\"" was a no-name $8 bottle of California sparkling.  The cost of the package was more than the champagne and restaurant credit.  Bring your own bubbly.

Being our 10th wedding anniversary we wanted something special (we booked the weekend romance package) and not too expensive (gulp...see note below).  We booked well in advance and booked room 309 (beautiful king room with stunning views).  The room was perfect in that it was extremely private and we felt like we were the only ones there (ok yes, it doesn't have a fabulous soaking tub but we knew that going in). The service from booking, to front desk, dining, & house keeping was fantastic.  At one point we thought we had to cancel (so we did), then we didn't need to (so we called back) and no issues at all. \n\nLet me clarify the \""not too expensive\"".  As part of our treat we wanted to splurge a little and our weekend price tag came in around $750 for the 2 nights at booking. I hesitated but decided to go with it.  The pleasant surprise is (and they tell you this at booking but I don't think underline it enough) that the amount covers so much i.e. champagne in room, gratuities for included meals and meals that are HUGE so really looking back it was great value given where we were staying.  \n\nIn short, we would book there again and if anything, at least go for brunch (the chocolate mousse is to die for!)",5,positive

Lots of lover things close by, horse drawn buggys, restaurants, parks, a very trendy area.

The food in the restaurant is way overpriced for what you get, and over salted. There is no designated smoking area or ashtrays so there are cigarette butts everywhere outside the doors? I'm not a smoker but really? The establishment is snobby. I have no idea why. Also I have no idea when the bar closes but I wanted a drink at 9pm and the entire bar was shut off for a wedding so I couldn't order one. What? I ended up buying a bottle of wine through room service as that was the only way....weird.

Back in July 2017 I booked a room at the Inn for early February 2018, the week of the Superbowl in Minneapolis. I booked early because I knew the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was going to be difficult to find lodging the longer I waited. I was delighted to reserve a room at the Inn because it was out of the mainstream of downtown Minneapolis and its location allowed us to explore other parts of the city. In mid-November 2017, I received a phone call from the Inn informing me they were cancelling my reservation because another party booked the entire Inn for the week of the Superbowl. To apologize for the inconvenience, the Inn made a reservation for me at another hotel in the heart of downtown, but at a cost of over $100 more for the night. When I asked what they could to do for me because they cancelled my reservation, the Inn stated it would assure me of a special stay the next time I book with them. Due to the inconvenience and higher cost at the other hotel, I requested the Inn pay the difference in the room rate because I was given no choice in the matter and their posted cancellation policy does not state the Inn reserves the right to cancel a reservation. The owner agreed to pay the difference \""out of his own pocket\"" if we stayed at the other more expensive hotel, but after thinking about the location and why we chose Nicollet Island Inn in the first place, I said I did not want to stay at the other hotel; I again asked what they could do for me. The response was nothing. While I can understand the owner's\u002Fmanagement financial decision to go with a big party for the entire week, it was handled in a less than customer friendly manner: I, and probably others who were proactive and reserved a room early, were given no choice, the Inn chose to book the big party prior to honoring and contacting customers who had planned well in advance. Reserving a room at another more costly hotel without any incentive was their only solution for the inconvenience. The promise for a \""special stay\"" the next time we book leaves much to be desired, especially after my reservation was abruptly cancelled by them. The inconvenience and disappointment experienced from the Inn cancelling my reservation are significant. The Inn is off my 'wish to stay' list. I won't put myself at risk of being cancelled again if a bigger fish comes along.",2,negative

Marble bath, high ceilings, velvet drapery and shuttered windows. King bed with high-thread count sheets and a just-right pillow top mattress. Our room came with terry robes and and comfortable couch and chair. It was quiet - city sounds are muffled and we never heard other guests.

The so called \""luxury suite\"" was a stuffy, dark room with a window the size of a turret window, and an old fashioned air conditioner that blew warm stale air. They moved me to another room, --- this one had a tiny window that literally faced a cement wall. Air conditioner worked, albeit it sounded like a train was constantly running through the room.\n\nBut let's say we just had super bad luck, The hotel was oversold, so few rooms were available. The general hotel vibe was kind of creepy. Low ceilings, weird lighting, everything slightly off, a setting for a Coen brothers movie. Stingy not 4 star details. Like they have no soap, just soap containers bolted to the wall. The air conditioner does not allow you to make it colder than 68 even if it's defective and sweltering. They give you no complimentary water bottles, forcing you to raid the mini bar. Details inconsistent with my experience of good hotels.\n\nFinally, and I almost never complain about this type of thing -- the front desk staff, while nice enough, were poor. They charged me for a so called luxury suite although they had moved me for my cement wall room. When I pointed out that this was a regular room, they said they would discount it by 50 bucks although this is not typically the price difference between the 2 rooms.

Electric outlets and Internet access was convenient.  Who thought of putting a TV in the bathroom when one is in the bath tub ?  The adjacent shower was clean, but awkward:  if the bathroom door is partly open, one cannot get out of the shower !  The room bar had the usual items with the usual grand hotel price mark up.  When we tried to buy bottled water at the bar on the 2nd floor, the bar tender was so slow and inefficient.  Fortunately, we did not need ice, or it would have been melted by the time we were ready for a drink.\nBreakfast was very good and reasonably priced.\nThe big question is:  would we return on our next week end visit to Minneapolis ?

The Walgreens is a 10-15 minute walk and there are limited dining options within a 5 block radius.\nThere's a decent executive lounge that serves breakfast and evening snacks, along with Pepsi products. (Though if they put you in a room near the mezzanine, it will be about a full city block walk to get to the lounge. That was no fun, but not their fault;  I didn't know enough to ask.)   \n\nThe room was just OK.  There were no bureau drawers, which made it tough to store anything didn't hang up.

When she learned that it was her computer, and not my card that was the problem, not only did she not apologize for embarrassing me, she shrugged and said \""well I can't check you in anyways.\""  I nearly left right there, and probably should have.  Later, I called downstairs to let them know about the water pressure problems that I mentioned above, and I asked the gentleman who answered-   just out of curiosity, why the room did not have any drawers or bathroom vanity space.  He sniffed that they had recently gone through a \""million dollar renovation\"" and they are sorry, but they \""can't please everyone\"".  That kind of flippant and thoughtless remark sounded just defensive enough to tell me that I wasn't the first to complain about those things.\n\nThe rudeness really surprised me.

This hotel was convenient to the one item on our downtown Mpls to-do list, the Mill City Museum (also a recommend in our book). We heard tell that you're only a block from one entrance to the famed Skyway, but didn't take advantage. \nSince we were driving everywhere else, the heated underground garage self-parking with in-and-out was a huge plus.  And despite the labyrinthine hallways on the guest floors, we were quite close to the secondary elevator, for easy access to our car at all times. \nThe room was nice, nothing exceptional. It had the feel of an older hotel that had recently been refreshed with new surfaces\u002Fdecor\u002Ffurniture. At check-out it transpired that it's only been a Renaissance for around a year. There was only one chair (at the desk, but not a swivel\u002Foffice-type), which was too bad, since there were three of us and there seemed to be room for at least one lounge-type chair. The view was 'city', so there was a lot of light, but nothing in particular to see. The abundance of light was especially obvious in the mornings, since the blinds (one of which was black-out) didn't completely do their job.  The curtains were purely decorative and didn't cover the windows.    \nSadly, the club lounge is closed on weekends, so we couldn't take advantage during our Friday-Sunday stay.\nOur few interactions with employees were efficient and charming. Check-in was easy (one hiccup, completely my own fault, I forgot some paperwork, was smoothly handled and followed up flawlessly). We declined housekeeping service and checked-out by phone. \nNext time I'm in Mpls, The Depot is top-of-list, a definite recommend.",5,positive

UGH\n      **in this mess of an environment, Ryan is awesome \n*front desk staff is very good \n*in room dining is vey good; watch out for those service charges\n*rooms aren\u2019t special, but they are clean,  spacious enough, and most importantly more quiet than the average hotel room \n\nFirst, I used an e-certificate for one of our nights so Inhad to call the general reservation # to make the reservation. I spoke with the rudest manager ever - \u201CAlex with an x\u201D. I still need to call customer service to deal with that. However, this has no direct reflection  on the service at the hotel itself. \n\nSecond, the hotel charges $36\u002Fnight for valet but only has one person  on duty at any one time, and this person is responsible for both valet and  bellboy services.  There was a guy on duty at night that seemed fairly new, perhaps, that caused a bit of chaos. Regardless things were backed up when we arrived and people were confused, aggravated, complaining, and angry.  ((You can self park.)\nWhile we were staying at the hotel, a man named Ryan provided the services during the day. He provided the services as well as anyone possibly could and gave us great tips on how to do some of the things we wanted to do. For example, we mentioned that we wanted to go across the state line to grab a geocache, and he  Took the time to give us directions to Stillwater and and State Park, which included a beautiful drive. We really enjoyed seeing him every day. He was a great part of our stay actually. \n\n And the guy that checked us in, unfortunately I cannot recall his name, did a great job as well. He was very friendly help me relax after I had dealt with the cumbersome valet\u002Fbellhop mentioned above. \n\n When you book a room, you can opt for a historical suite or just get a standard room. We got a standard room  on the fourth floor to be near the concierge lounge. Unfortunately it is closed on the weekend, which includes Friday nights. I was told that because it\u2019s closed on weekends, we are provided breakfast though. I found the lounge to be small and the food to be wanting, so they free breakfast is a nice conciliation exchange. \n\n We ordered room service or last night there. I had the fillet mignon, my spouse had a Caesar salad with risotto and chicken added. We like everything very much. The menu says the mail will be delivered and 20 minutes unless otherwise stated I was told on The phone that they meal would be delivered in 30 minutes, and it was.\n There are two service charges posted on the bill. I asked the waitress if one of them is a tip, which of course is only logical. ( my brain was tired, I don\u2019t know I asked that )  she responded, \u201Cwell it\u2019s a bucket pot, if you\u2019ve ever heard of that.\u201C I gave her quizzical look, and she said \u201CI love it goes in a pot and we split it at the end of the night. \u201COf course that means it\u2019s a tip. She was obviously trying to get more money from me.  She should\u2019ve just said yes it is a tip. That sort of annoys me, even with the fact that I used to wait tables but it is what it is. I still added a few bucks. My brain really was time. \n\nThe room was clean, the tv was large. Lots of lamps and plenty of channels.  Also, you have the opportunity to log into your Netflix and other similar streaming video accounts on the TV. One impressive factor  was how quiet the room was.

A major water main break took out the main elevators so the entire hotel used the one remaining elevator including housekeeping, the emergency cleanup crews, guests and staff. This led to long waits for the elevator. The televisions on the third floor apparently didn't all work and my first room that was the case. I was reassigned to the 6th floor which smelled musty and the a\u002Fc didn't work in the hallway the first night. On Thursday night at 12:30AM, the fire alarm began alarming. While the strobes were flashing and the horns were screaming, a security guard was yelling for everyone to stay in their rooms. Many of us ignored him and walked down the stairs. In the lobby, there was staff chaos as apparently, no one knew how to turn the alarms off (it was apparently a false alarm). Finally, the fire department figured out how to do it after the fire department key wouldn't open the street level control box and someone led them to the basement. I then had to walk back up 6 flights of stairs since the one working elevator was jammed with every guest in the place. When I awoke the next morning on checkout day, I found a nice envelop under my door. I expected it to be an apology or something but it was actually a welcome letter and two breakfast passes that I never received when I checked in. As I was checking out, there was no mention or apology for the flood, lack of elevators, lack of sleep due to fire alarms or anything.

Upon check in, I worked with a young lady that had no idea what day it was, put the wrong dates on our breakfast vouchers as well as the platinum elite $10 welcome voucher, and then told me that our room, 485, was on the fifth floor. When I asked to clarify that 400 level rooms were on the 5th floor, the girl looked at me like I was crazy.

I think in the future I would rather stay at a Courtyard or Residence Inn for at least at these properties my expectations won't be set as high. I think what was most disappointing was the 3 times I tried to reach out throughout my stay to give feedback to a manager but was never connected or followed up with by one. I understand that the app was down for the weekend (despite no one ever telling me) but for me to ask to speak to a manager in the morning after breakfast to be told there was no one on duty at the time (how do you not have a manager on at 10 am in the morning?).

Note, you are not supposed to bring outside beverages into the waterpark, however, you are allowed to bring drinks in from the hotel bar in plastic cups.  They also server a small selection of beer in the mezzanine (Coors light and Mich light I think).\n\nThere is also the skating rink.

The staff was very kind and kept my boxes I used at the conference before, during, and after the conference.  The room was fairly quiet.

Unfortunately 2 weeks before the marathon the race director chose to change the start line and now the hotel was 5 miles away from the start. \n\nAnyways, when we first got here after a long drive we mistakenly went to the Renaissance Inn portion of this hotel instead of the Residence Inn. Signage could have been marked better to clearly distinguish which hotel is what since they are attached. I would definitely classify this as a family hotel and had I known this I would have chosen to stay at the Renaissance next door. There is a water park attached to the hotel and there are kids running around and screaming everywhere. We asked for a quiet room because we had to be up at 4:30am to run the marathon. When we got to our room all we could here were kids running around in the room above ours. Sounded like they were going to fall through the floor it was so loud. After going to bed early we were woken up by the same noisy kids\u002Fadults running around. Thankfully they quieted down but not after waking us up.\n\nThe rooms are really nice though and we had a one bedroom queen suite. The separate living room and full size kitchen area were nice although we didn't get a chance to use them much. It was great to be able to spread out though. The beds were not very comfortable but the room was clean. Breakfast was merely ok but what do you expect for a free breakfast.\n\nAgain, if you don't like kids running around then book elsewhere.

Our living room was spacious, the kitchen well stocked and the bedroom a tad crammed with furniture. \n\nBreakfast was of average quality, but presented abundant options for every taste and the cozy room with the pool table provided moments of fun and relaxation.  While there is no bar at the Residence Inn, the one at the Renaissance, at the opposite end of the ample parking lot, is pretty good.  Although a long indoor corridor will take you there, we recommend going through the parking lot to avoid the loud commotion at the Depot Waterpark indoors swimming pools, slides and arcade\u2026 On the other hand, we are sure that your kids will love it!\n\nThe very convenient location is walking distance to the wonderful Stone Arch Bridge over the Mississippi river, the surprisingly modern Guthrie Theatre (which affords sweeping views of the Mississippi river), the University of Minnesota, Nicollet Island and \u201Cold town\u201D.  We also walked to Nicollet Mall, a lovely walk along this downtown neighborhood where you can visit Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s statue (ant take your picture next to it!), enjoy the stores, lively atmosphere and finish your day at one of the restaurants.  We enjoyed cocktails and good Italian food at Zelo. A car would probably be most convenient if you'll also want to visit neighboring St. Paul. \n\nAll in all, a fine choice for convenient access to most attractions in Minneapolis.",3,negative

data/ca/43323/224077/247971940.html,Residence Inn Minneapolis Downtown at The Depot,"""We stayed at the Residence Inn in Minneapolis for quite a while, and the staff there is amazing.  From the front desk to the breakfast and dinner attendants to the housekeepers, there might be no hotel in the world with a more thoughtful, attentive group of employees.  I absolutely loved the people I met while we were here, and even though I haven't been there in a few months, I still think of several of them by name and wonder how they are doing. (We were there a long time, as I said.)\n\nThere is a lot that I loved about this hotel (see last paragraph), but I would be remiss if I didn't mention how absolutely disappointing our room was.  First, it was very, very far from elevators.  We joked that we had to do the Marriott Death March every time we went home.  The hallways were in pretty bad shape with ripped carpet seams and a generally old-looking interior.  The beds in the rooms were very, very comfortable, but all of the other furnishings were old and even disgusting.  They allow pets at this hotel, so our couch and chair had all been chewed on and scratched up, plus the coffee table looked like something that people might put next to their trash can with a \""free\"" sign. They also advertise a kitchenette, but even though there is a full-size oven and stove, they don't have any baking dishes that guests can borrow.  For an extended stay, I was pretty disappointed with the accommodations.  If the staff hadn't been so friendly and the location so perfect, I'm certain we would have left.  The rumor as I was leaving was that the rooms were getting a makeover, so if that's the case, I wouldn't have a single reservation about recommending this hotel to others.\n\nThe highlights of the hotel are many, and for my own family, they made up for the sketchy rooms.  Top on my list of great things about the hotel, besides the staff, are the breakfast, which is absolutely delicious, and the dinners three nights a week.  The dinners aren't the best meals in the world, but they are kid-friendly and free, and I didn't have to cook them, clean up after them, or pay for them, so I'd say they are a major plus.  The location is fantastic--right near the Mill City Museum, the Guthrie Theater, and the Mississippi River, plus a trendy, fun neighborhood with million-dollar condos all around and a Whole Foods grocery store down the street.  My kids were a little old for the water park, but if you have toddlers or kids up to around age 8, they will absolutely love the indoor water park at the hotel.  My kids (9 and 12) had a good time there, but I kept thinking that I wish we'd stayed there when my son was about three.  The water park has a train theme that so many of the little kids loved.  The train makes a big whistling sound, then water comes out from all the overhead spouts, and the kids laugh and squeal, and it just looks so perfect and delightful for little ones.  In the winter, there is an ice rink which my big kids might have enjoyed, but we left before it opened, unfortunately.\n\nIn short, I would happily stay there again someday, especially if the rooms get new furniture, but I felt like we paid too much for the room we had, given the condition of the furniture and interior leading up to it.  That said, I think fondly of the people working there, and I think it's a real testament to them that we ended up staying at the hotel instead of leaving.",3,negative

The room is very spacious with a nice couch, desk, small eating table & a full functional small kitchen. \n\nThis is a nice area of Minneapolis. It's quieter than staying in the heart of downtown and still close enough to walk everywhere. No one hassles you for money in this area. It's a short walk to the light rail too. \n\nWe will stay here again. The only complaint I have is that the WIFI is spotty. I'm assuming this may be due to construction.

We had only been to the Minneapolis area once before & had spent our time then in the suburbs, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this location.  We loved it!  \n\n1) If you are a runner, as I am, this is a great location to head out from.  Hotel is 2 blocks from paved path running along Mississippi River.  I headed north along it for my run. Lots of people out running, walking, & biking along the path & Stone Arch Bridge; I felt safe the entire time.  I think foot exploration is the best way to see the city!  Returned to hotel on Day 2 of our stay to see race registration signs, so aI was able to register for a race starting right in front of the hotel the next morning that utilized portions of the same route I had run on earlier.  The whole town looks to have plenty of running\u002Fwalking\u002Fbiking options.\n\n2) Located in walkable area.  Old Mill Ruins & Stone Arch Bridge is a neat area 2 blocks away, along Mississippi River.  Located a few blocks from downtown & Nicollette Mall area in the other direction.  We enjoyed walking downtown one night.  There were plenty of other people out & about.  We had beautiful spring weather, but there are skyways if it is cold.  Quick walk to Caribou Coffee or Subway located kitty-corner from hotel; other things a longer walk away, but not too terribly far.\n\n3) Great transportation system on the metro trains accessible about 3-4 blocks west of hotel. We used it to get to the Mall of America, but can also use it to get to U of MN, airport, etc.  With this hotel location it would be easy to park your car & walk or use public transportation for the duration of your stay if you choose.\n\n4) Hotel room was nicely updated (we had a queen bed with sofa bed suite), roomy, & clean.  Considering the downtown location, we were happily surprised at how quiet it was.  We heard sirens twice, but nothing really disturbing during our 3-night stay.\n\n5) Nicely updated lobby & breakfast area with great breakfast options.  I liked that they had plain oatmeal (my breakfast of choice) ready in a crockpot with toppings available next to it; much preferable to packets.  Fruit, yogurt, waffles, eggs, meat, etc. also available.  We were able to fill up enough to satisfy us until we could eat after our college tour.\n\n6) Friendly hotel staff.\n\nWe were so happy to have ended up in such a great location\u002Fhotel for our trip.  This will be our hotel of choice for return trips, which could be many if our son decides to attend U of MN.\n",4,positive

I asked  for a quiet room, and he attempted to give us one.  However, we had a few problems with the room.  1.  No king size beds in the entire hotel!   That's discrimination against tall people.  I'm a tall person.  2. AC unit was VERY loud!  It was in an outdoor closet just outside the bedroom, and when it kicked on, it was the loudest AC unit I've ever heard!  3.  SIngle pane windows.  The street traffic wasn't that heavy, but because of the single pane windows, you could hear every car that went by as if the window was open.  4.  Refridgerator was also noisy.  My wife added that comment.  One other note--the pillows were the classic hotel pillow conundrum--1 pillow too flat, 2 pillows too steep.  Been here before.\n\nThis hotel comes across like it was built on the cheap:  single pane instead of dual pane windows, queen beds instead of king, cheap ac units that make more noise than more expensive ones.  Expenses were spared when they built this hotel.  The lobby looks very nice and modern, the breakfast served was good, about as expected, service at the front desk was very good.

You really don't need to move your car out of the convenient parking area (which only charged $15 a day\u002Fweekend rate).

The neighborhood is the old Mill neighborhood and it is beautiful with great older architecture and a flavor for the old railroad days.  Great walking to park, river, restaurants, even bars with old style character.  The Renaissance is more upscale with nicer, more expensively detailed rooms-- but they are traditional rooms with two double beds.  The Residence Inn is a suite hotel, with a living area & full kitchen, separate bedroom and bath.  The details (furniture, walls, doors) are less expensive.  We could hear the people above us walking and the plumbing made noise in the early morning.  However, that was are only concern at the Residence.  The people are very nice, the property is spotless, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is extremely good:  eggs, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, fruit-- even strong coffee (which one doesn't always find in the midwest).  The pool is a square and not really adequate for lap swimming.  The fitness room is huge and has plenty of good modern equipment.  I recommend both properties, although the Renaissance is under some construction which means noise during the day.  The Residence has great firm beds and (except for some big people walking up above) promises for a peaceful sleep.  I would be hard pressed to make a choice between the two hotels.  Maybe Renaissance for a short stay; Residence for a longer stay.  I cannot say enough about this great location, the charm of the neighborhood, and you can walk to downtown.",4,positive

data/ca/43323/224077/570181596.html,Residence Inn Minneapolis Downtown at The Depot,"""When we travel as a family of 5, a two bedroom suite at the Residence Inn is our go to hotel room.  With two bedrooms and a common room in between (including a pull out sofa), it's a lot of space for the money and makes it a little easier to accommodate teens who don't want to sleep in the same bed.  The pool and exercise space were good (but no hot tub).  The breakfast had the usual offerings for Residence Inn and they're good and consistent.  With gold elite status, we got the faster internet so that was nice.  This Residence Inn was a great location with parking outside and underground ($15\u002Fnight).  The location of our room was pretty bad on the first floor immediately adjacent to the lobby.  The windows didn't block much street noise although it wasn't the noisiest part of town.  The door actually did block a fair amount of noise from the lobby.  Unfortunately, nothing could block the noise of the kids running around in the room above us at 6:30am.  (Not the hotel's fault).  That's why we prefer a higher floor but they were fully booked it seemed.  The front desk staff was a little overwhelmed due to it being so busy, but still very friendly and accommodating.  Unfortunately, no roll away beds were available but we checked in late, so that's just the luck of the draw, same with room location.  It snowed overnight and I have to give the staff credit for the very prompt snow removal in the morning.  I wish there was more than one temperature control between the three rooms.  The thermostat is in the main common area.  One of the bedrooms was very hot and needed to close the vent fully.  The other bedroom was very cold.  Despite some issues, I'd still stay here again, because of the staff, location, and value, but I'd really prefer a higher floor.",4,positive

There is a bit of train history spread throughout the hotel; antique dishes and menus for dining service on the routes.  The coolest thing to me was exploring the depot attached to the hotel.  There were lots of historical pictures of the building and a few areas that had been restored or remodeled to how they used to look.

The person checking me in was giving me the email address when her coworker rudely interjected (without looking at me) \""if she doesn't have the letter, she pays full rate\"".  I said \""what did you just say?\""  I was ignored by both and I then said \""that was very rude\"".  Again, no eye contact and ignored by both check in agents.  I emailed the PDF to the front desk.  I did not want to discuss further as the check-in area is small and it was busy at the time of my check-in.

Towneplace let us check in early since our flight got in at 10 AM, and also let us check out late and stash our luggage behind the desk while we went around town on our last day.

Hotwire said I was booking a room for four, but didn't explain that the room we'd booked was a studio that had a CAPACITY of 4.  (They don't tell you where you're staying until you've made a nonrefundable booking that you'd have to die or sacrifice your first born to get out of.)  So two of us had to sleep on a sofa bed, which was actually incredibly uncomfortable.  It felt like a pancake with springs in it.

Hotel parking is $15 per night; downtown locations are $1 per hour, often limited to 4 hours.\n\nThe reception staff were great--always friendly and especially helpful in giving directions and advise about local attractions.  I liked the large wall  map at reception which the staff were able to  skillfully use to give directions.  The room was very clean, large and very comfortable for an extended stay.  All units have a full kitchen, some have a separate \""computer\"" room.   Bedding and mattress were very comfortable and the interior and exterior of the building quiet, conducive for a good night's sleep.  During the day, natural light was excellent; artificial lighting was also excellent so you could comfortably work in the evening.  The Window had a thick drape to block out the early morning sun, and also for privacy.  The hotel location was good--about three blocks from the light rail station as well as along the city bus route.  \n\nI should also mention that when we came home at the end of the day, the room was always sparkling clean, the same for common areas (breakfast room, sitting room, game room).  The game room had a pool table along with a television and tables\u002Fchairs.  Breakfast was better than average which included eggs and sausage patties along with the regular continental breakfast fare.    The hotel had a good sized pool, which was closed for the season during our stay.  They provided a a gas barbecue on the patio.  Unfortunately, during our stay it was not working.  Hopefully, they will get it up and running again!\n\nI highly recommend this hotel for its location, level of comfort, attentive staff and overall maintenance and physical appearance.",5,positive

We were on the third floor and had a good view but were told fourth floor views are wonderful. Our kitchenette room was excellent with a full domestic size refrigerator, stove, dishwasher  and an impressive supply of crockery, cutlery, glasses, pots, pans, coffee maker and microwave and we did eat in. The bathroom was very well fitted out with large hairdryer and a very well organised vanity cupboard for storage. Bedroom, lounge, desk area all combined but very comfortable. \nThe breakfast room is well organised and spacious and the lady in charge did an outstanding job during our stay as it apparently coincided with a graduation and the hotel was full and the breakfast room packed but food plentiful and the fruit bowls overflowed with beautiful fruit. Hot and cold food choices topped up constantly. \nThe corner store across the road sold an impressive range of groceries, fruit and meals to suit most diet inclinations. There are some interesting bars and micro breweries in the immediate vicinity. Recommend the Goat Cheese toasted sandwich from the food van in the rear alley. Simply delicious.\nTarget Field, the Twins baseball field is a 10 minutes walk away and well worth looking at and the train stop is there and easy to get into the city if walking not an option and easy to get into St. Paul.

It\u2019s food, not cuisine but more than enough fuel the start to my day although I can see how it could become quickly repetitive for guests on a longer stay than my two-night duration.\n\nThe heated outdoor pool is open daily 9 AM \u2013 9 PM with the pool deck at the rear of the building beside the parking lot however boasting enough loungers and a scenic city skyline view.\n\nFor a three-star value suite hotel the TownePlace Suites Minneapolis Downtown\u002FNorth Loop  delivers a comfortable stay with a convenient location within walking distance of the Minneapolis city sights and a wealth of local craft breweries so more than met my expectations.",4,positive

We also had one dinner at the restaurant, which also was very good -- both the good and service were excellent.  We would have had more meals at the restaurant if we could have. It is only open for dinner Wednesday to Saturday and during our stay there was a private party occupying the space on all but one of the nights.  It definitely detracts from staying at the hotel.

We did not try it as an option for dinner again.\n\nThere is no pool on location but there is a fitness facility, which is good.\n\nNot reflecting the hotel but downtown Minneapolis is not the nicest of locations.

We arrived at the hotel and before we could even stop the truck (we have a very large truck) the valet had a stick ready to measure the height of the truck. Unfortunately the truck was too tall, however he was helpful in showing us to 2 different parking lots very close to the hotel. He was very friendly and helpful. Great way to start the stay. Check in was easy. I booked through Booking.com. I only had my debit card (oops!) and the front desk clerk said he would take it, but warned that they do put a hold on funds until it clears and he didn't like the idea of that (which was nice he was looking out for me). He explained the elevators, the WiFi information, the bar information and hours, etc. We inquired about going to the Mall of America and how long it would take to drive. He told us how long it would take, but also mentioned that there was an event going on and that it may be heavy on the traffic and suggested us to take the LRT, which is conveniently located across the street and costs 2 dollars to get to The Mall of America (takes approx 35 minutes). \nThe room itself is beautiful. Clean, bright, GREAT channels (hubby ended up with the stomach flu so much time was spent in the room). The bathroom is nice, there is a TV in there and a beautiful shower. \nOverall I was VERY impressed with the staff, the room, the bar, etc. Minneapolis itself is a BEAUTIFUL city, I would 100% go back and stay at the Loews again, and will likely stay at other Loews throughout my future travels.",5,positive

The small closet has an iron and table and a hairdryer along with gowns.

I originally had booked a suite but it wasn't really the one I wanted.  Two days prior to me coming to Loews, I received a e-mail offering an upgrade for a negotiated price.  I called the hotel and spoke to Darren.  I had already spoken to another salesperson there but she wasn't negotiating.  She only gave me the same price the website gave me.  Upon speaking to Darren, without asking, he negotiated a phenomenal price for the best suite in the house, The Performer Suite.  There is much to be said about this suite, especially if you are a Prince fan.  The room is as big as most single family homes.  It has artwork of Prince on the wall and, oh yes, it also has a purple wall in the dining room. Of course, this was the color Prince was known by. It also has a baby grand piano in it with a sitting area for your listening enjoyment, a workout room, 2 bathrooms, a large bedroom with a king bed, a bar with a refrigerator and snacks. It includes a large living room and the entire room is modernly decorated.  We LOVED LOVED LOVED it.

Room is very modern, including USB ports and lots of plugs, tv in bathroom, nice widescreen in room, and a great king bed with high thread sheets.  Iron\u002Fboard and hairdryer helped us get ready for events of the weekend.  Minibar is typically outrageous.  Nice view west from our 20th floor room.  They do need to change the carpets in our room, but halls and elevators had neat marble floors.  Shower in our room had multi jets and a handheld and we didn\u2019t miss the absence of a tub.  Enjoyed our stay very much.  ",5,positive

Pretty much every single thing was an extra charge. But no worries I was given a suite, I think it was their smallest. It had two bathrooms, a living room and bedroom. 3 TVs total, except the one in the bathroom was a little fuzzy. But the main bathroom came equipped with a rain shower and a giant whirlpool tub. It was very relaxing and their soaps smelled great. I looked and rummaged in the mini bar and snacks, but didn't partake. A nice size bottled water was running 9 dollars. I posted a picture of the prices, which was embedded into the granite table making it very hard to identify prices.  The view was amazing from the 21st floor. I will admit that I was given some questioning looks from other hotel patrons as I pushed the envious Pent House floor. I got breakfast and ordered it for room service. Two orders bacon, crossiant, pancakes,  fruit, can of coke, and apple juice. It ran a total of 80 dollars. The car service was 45 dollars per night. I half was expecting it to be washed. The average hotel bar was trying to make very fancy drinks. The average cocktail price was around 14 dollars. I didn't mind the prices, hell everything was listed so I knew the prices.

data/ca/43323/596092/528329591.html,Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown Hotel,"""I have no idea how this is a category 4-rated hotel. I have literally stayed at Category 2 hotels that seemed like the St. Regis compared to this property. I was mislead by ratings that are clearly from people that stayed at a different hotel, because I cannot understand how anyone would rate this downright filthy hotel with less than helpful\u002Fhospitable staff as highly as they have. \n\nLRA would have totally slammed this hotel, because not one procedure was followed. No welcome. No Platinum acknowledgement. No club access or upgrade offered as a result of ignoring the status. The agent (Cameron) was truly the most indifferent unenthusiastic person with whom I have interacted at the desk. I get the impression that he might be new to the desk or from another department based on his uniform that was not consistent with a Sheraton front desk uniform. I didn\u2019t expect to interact with him again so I hoped that he would be further developed before too many other guests had to experience him - perhaps by Natasha who was pleasant and calm under pressure as other guests seemed to have been having issues even on a day that she admitted was not busy. (Back to Cameron later)\n\nI eventually checked into the filthiest room. It was quite small. The carpet so soiled that the one entering the hotel was actually cleaner. The poorly cleaned room surprised me since housekeeping seem so eager to clean it as evidenced by them banging on my door twice and even calling a third time despite my guaranteed late checkout. Even the shower curtain was brown although it was originally white. The tub was clean though so that was the sole plus from a cleanliness perspective. It is my understanding based on the GM\u2019s response to other reviews here that a remodel is forthcoming, but that is no excuse for an unkept property in the meantime. \n\nI had the opportunity to visit the club lounge. It was clean. Good beverage selection. Awful evening appetizers though. BBQ hot dogs? Really? Different strokes, I suppose. \n\nUnfortunately, the stay got worse. The power went out for a significant amount of time. I did not call down immediately because I figured enough guests were calling down to inquire so I didn\u2019t want to bother the staff. After just under an hour and after noticing the power was on everywhere else nearby, I called down where Cameron greeted me with the reply \u201CGuest Services\u201D (no name initially given). I asked if there was an update on the power and if they knew what happened. He responded \u201Cit went out.\u201D That was literally his response and his version of guest service. I finally asked for his name and suggested that his response was non-responsive and obvious. (I knew the power was off as I was standing in a hot dark room.) My purpose in calling was to see if an estimate had been given for repair because I was ready to pack and leave for the Westin. After a pause he finally gave his name. \n\nI immediately got on the phone despite being exhausted by travel and was ready to leave. I was on the phone with the Platinum Concierge making a reservation for the Westin (shockingly the same category) when the power came back on. I decided to stay due to fatigue. I wish I hadn\u2019t because the roach I saw the next morning made me realize the place was even dirtier than I could initially see. I was surprised no broadcast message was sent. Surprised that there was no letter under the door apologizing. I\u2019m not sure why I was surprised. \n\nI see from the GM\u2019s responses here that the renovation is coming, an admission that carpets shouldn\u2019t be dirty, and that attempts are made to hire good staff. My question is if all of these things are known, why have they not been addressed. Carpets can be cleaned. Rooms can be put offline or made last see when not busy. Staff can be counseled on acceptable conduct. There is no evidence of any such steps being taken. What\u2019s even more shocking is that the Sheraton Minneapolis West where I stayed on Saturday but which was sold out for Sunday - hence my stay at this property - was leaps and bounds above Midtown in every way and was just  a Category 3 (likely due to distance from the city\u2019s center). \n\nWhat an awful way to end my experience in a lovely city. Almost 550 nights at Starwood (now Marriott) Hotels. This stay takes its place among the bottom 5 stays! ",1,negative

It is branded as a \""prototype\"" hotel, which I think means that it was developed based on an enterprise level conceptualization of what such hotels should look like.The rooms are small and beige, but relatively clean and inoffensive. Staff seems friendly enough, and the gym is above average, with decent equipment and a nice-sized internal pool. I did not try the restaurant, but it seemed to be active.\nThe neighborhood is strange, however. It is not what you would call a good part of town, with a liquor store across the street and fast food ethnic restaurants with signs on the doors asking patrons not to bring in guns or trespass, and lingering groups of disheveled men on the street corners talking rather loudly and looking at passersby suspiciously. At the same time, there are some obvious attempts at gentrification, and the hotel is next to (and in fact built on the old parking lot of) the Midtown Exchange, a very quaint Minneapolis of the 1920's building which used to be the home of Sears and now has fancy lofts and offices, along with a gourmet supermarket on the first floor. It is also next to a large bus depot, which has the con of attracting a certain crowd and the pro of making it very accessible, if you are comfortable using public transportation. \nI ventured out for dinner and ate at a Mexican fast food joint on Lake Street which was excellent- however, the one-block walk felt uncomfortable. Upon asking the hotel staff if the area was safe, I was told that \""it is like everywhere else\""... \nThe room I stayed in had a bit of occasional noise from the street (sirens and buses) but nothing you would not expect in a city setting.

But perfectly fine for a short trip. It was the staff that was most disappointing. \n\n1.) Rude restaurant experience: In the morning I tried to eat at the restaurant and planned to work. The dining room was empty, but when I sat at a 4 top the waiter\u002Fbartender said \u201Csit at that table\u201D pointing to a small 2 top that would only fit my laptop. When I asked it this table was okay, he said again to move. I explained I\u2019d rather sit at the 4 person table because I\u2019m going to work.

Sit at the other table, you\u2019re only one person.\u201D Normally I would have understood managing the tables, but it was already 9 am and the dining room was completely empty. The likelihood my sitting at a 4 person table would interfere with sitting other guests was extremely low, and his rude attitude, not even once asking politely, was uncalled for.

Location is great, all theaters and many restaurants and bars are walkable.\n\nI stayed in an Executive Suite - huge room, all in white with modern, delightful original artwork in the room. Great bathroom - with floor heating, large and bright walk-in shower. Comfortable sofa and seating area, huge flat-screen TV. Great working desk with Eames working chair.

It's a large diameter rain showerhead.  Tons of hot water, blue-tiled walls, glass door.  I like the coffee maker: an Illy pod espresso machine.  It worked pretty well.\n\nNow for the negatives:  Nothing ages faster than tech.  What was a cool clock radio with an iphone charger is now a clock radio (unless you are still using an iphone 4 or earlier).  The flat screen tv is large but mounted wrong because the room is too small. You can't watch it straight on, you have to watch it at a 45 degree angle (at best).  But what's worse is that they do not have digital feed.  They have channels 0-99 in low res.  It looks like crap.  Plus, without a built-in tv guide, you often can't tell what is being broadcast because long tv commercials mean it could take a day to figure out what's actually on.  When I called service to complain about the tv, they offered to send in a maintenance guy.  I said it wouldn't do any good unless he can swap out the signal.  Service was clueless, unhelpful and even rude.  The staff is very nice as long as you praise them but if you've got issues with the room, look out. They're rude.  The bathroom also has a tv: it looks like a 12\"" LG made more than a decade ago. It's wall mounted, the image is dull, pixelated and unwatchable.\n\nThe room is tiny and sound travels easily through the door so people talking as they walk buy sound like they are in your room.

While I was initially impressed with my room, as I paid more attention to the room, I noticed how old and decrepit the room was.  For what the Meridien brand is to Starwood, I would put the condition of the room on par with a seedy motel.  The styling and everything looks great but if it is in such poor condition, you should not offer this room unless it\u2019s the last room in the entire hotel.\n\nI also had an issue with the heating as well.  Despite the fact it was set on cool and set to 45 degrees, my room was 75 plus degrees, which was too warm for me.  After waiting patiently for about an hour, someone finally comes up to address the heat issue.  He fiddles around with the thermostat and is just as concerned as I was that something was not right.  His solution?  Open the windows to the freezing weather.  Umm OK.   I asked if anything else could be done and he said that was all he could think of.  The problem is the noise level is so loud outside, that you cannot get a good nights sleep.  So I just suffered through an uncomfortably hot room.  I was never offered another room.  I didn\u2019t ask, but if you don\u2019t have a properly controlled heating system, you would think that would be the first thing offered.\nOne last tip, do not valet.

I had to pay 100 dollar extra plus 25 dollar per-night for my dog. It is more expensive than other hotels in the U.S. that I had stayed. The dog is allowed in the room unattended, and the guest has to inform the front office on the duration and emergency phone number. I find that convenient the hotel allowed dogs to stay in the room unattended - my dog is well trained and he travels a lot with me, so he used to be in different places and behaving well.\nThe room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The only thing that bothers me is the paid wifi in the room. You have to pay extra for that - about 12 dollar p\u002Fday.

A luxury hotel does not say that the restaurant would open for breakfast at 6:30 AM and only open at 6:55 AM.

Friendly service and delicious food. \n- Shampoo smelled of mint. \n\nThings I was not fond of:\n- Conditioner smelled of cilantro. \n- Construction on the streets in front of the hotel was an inconvenience, no where for uber to pick up had to lug suitcases and walk to get away from construction to be able to get picked up.\n- Construction noise was jarring, although only occurred during daylight hours.\n- Elevator was poorly lit. I felt unsafe getting into a dark box as a woman travelling alone, a good general rule is to stick to well lit places.\n- TV was frustrating, no guide was available and trying to change channel seemed to freeze up the tv. I just wanted to find a sports channel, but after 15 minutes of trying still could not. Guide button on remote did not work. Could not find any on-demand tv options.

The bathroom is large with a very large shower (no tub in my room).  Shades block light when you are trying to sleep during the day.  Since my room faced the street, this was welcomed.  The bed was comfortable.  A complimentary water was available for guests.  The television operation was weird and I had a hard time finding the news.  Navigating through the channels took a long time and sometimes the channel would freeze and you never got to it.  Not sure if this is the case in all of the rooms, or just my experience.\n\nThere is a restaurant for your convenience that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Sunday night seemed really busy.  I am not as impressed with the breakfast as others, but it was sufficient.  \n\nWalking distance to restaurants, shops, First Avenue, Target Center, and many other attractions.

data/ca/43323/649095/444250294.html,The Westin Minneapolis,"""Pros:\n- Early check-in.  I read several reviews that said their rooms were not ready.  In my online SPG reservation I requested early check in. On the day of check in I received a text message from the front desk saying they were looking forward to my arrival and asking what time I planned to arrive and if there was anything they could do to prepare for my stay.  I texted back my arrival time and she confirmed she booked me into a cleaned and ready room and to arrive whenever.  I really loved that!  \n- Valet. $42\u002Fnight that allows you to come and go as much as you want.  The cars are kept in a heated garage so you need to call ahead and allow about 20 minutes for your car to be ready.  They were always ready within that time frame.\n- Room.  We stayed in a Grand Deluxe Double room and it was very spacious.  I love Westin beds the most out of any hotel chain - soft and comfortable.  Starbucks coffee.  Refrigerator.  Need to call room service for snacks. 2 bottles of complementary water for SPG members. \n- Bathroom.  Rain shower with okay water pressure.  You may need to use the wand shower head to get shampoo out of your hair.\n- Staff.  Everyone we encountered - front desk staff, valet, restaurant manager, were very nice and friendly.\n- Pool.  Nice pool and workout facility with locker rooms.\n- Location.  Connected via skyway to everything we wanted to do downtown.\n\nCons:\n- Although it's common, it's still annoying how many extra service charges are added into room service.  Something that looks like it is $15 ends up costing twice that.  I wish that they (and all hotels) would find a way to include those fees in the listed price of the food.\n- We had a late check out at 4:00.  We got back to the hotel at around 3:00 and our key no longer worked so we had to go to the front desk and have them re-code our key.  The early check-in process was so nice that although this isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, it was a little disappointing.\n- BANK.  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant BANK.  It was not busy in there at all.  A handful of people at the bar and a few tables of people.  We ordered 2 spaghetti dinners and it took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive after we ordered.  We had tickets for a show so we had to scarf it down.  The manager came over once and let us know they were short handed in the kitchen and he would try to hurry things up and our waiter came over a couple times to let us know the status.  I've been to BANK before for happy hours and for lunch it's generally not super speedy but this is the slowest service I've had.  Food was 3.5\u002F5.\n- Pet policy.  The Westin must be one of those hotels that allows pets because as we were leaving we almost stepped in poop that someone's pet had left little piles of along the rug.  Luckily neither one of us stepped in it, but unfortunately, one of the wheels of my luggage rolled through it.  I cleaned it off with a Kleenex and then rolled it outside into the snowbank to try to wash the rest of it off.  Then I went to tell the front desk what happened and they said someone else had told them and they were sending someone to clean it up.  I was a little put off that they didn't offer even a token, polite \""sorry for the mess\"".  Again, not that big of a deal in the big picture and it's certainly not the hotel's fault that someone's dog pooed in front of the door, but little things make an impression.\n\nOverall:\nBased on other reviews of this hotel, I was a bit concerned about the check-in process and the valet - both of which were great for me.  The things on my con list are not enough to prevent me from staying there again or from recommending the hotel to others.  I really like Westins and this was overall a pleasant and comfortable stay.",4,positive

The staff, that I interacted with, were friendly and professional at all times making my stay very enjoyable. The room was spacious, clean and well furnished with a clean up to date bathroom suite, that said maintenance possibly needs to look at the packing gland on the basin taps of room 722 as they leak onto the marble when in use but this was a minor issue and I'm a plumber by trade so sorry.

It is NOT handicap accessible, there are ladders to climb in and out. Also, the metal makes it slippery. Aside from that, the water temperature was fabulous and the water was incredibly soft! It was so smooth. The hot tub is actually hot, I\u2019m sure hotter than the standard 104\u00B0 at which most hot tubs are set at.

The bed I found very uncomfortable and hard so wasnt able to sleep well. I am female was traveling alone and stayed here since it was close to my where my conference was being held. Its not the hotels fault but it was very unsafe to leave the hotel and walk to restaurants etc at night due to the massive amounts of homeless people that hang out outside the door. I asked the clerk about a restaurant and I left to go and right when I walked out I was haggled, harassed and followed and it was very terrifying for me and I had to run back into the hotel and had to order through uber eats. It was winter and it was very cold so I'm sure this won't be an issue in the summer.  The maid left the stopper up in my sink so when I came back it was clogged and gross. Not like that when I left. The toilet also didn't work well, had to hold and flush 3 or 4 times.  I was right outside of the elevator so very noisy all hours or morning and night. Would bot stay here again.  There is a parking lot across the street for $16 a night and a parking ramp for $12 called Hawthorne that is very close and connected through the skyway so if it's cold out this is the best. The skyway is a walkway system for connecting buildings so you dont have to go outside. If you park at Hawthorne park on the 3rd floor go in the door to the building, turn left and then right and that leads you right to the hotel.

Target Center and Target field are similar distances for the hotel, making it a great place to stay if you have activities in DT Minneapolis.  \n\nWe booked 2 rooms (King and 2 Queen) to accommodate everyone.  The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable (both are crucial to returning to a hotel).  The exercise room was spacious and had the machines and free weights we needed for a complete workout.  Breakfast was standard for the Hampton Inn.  The elevator was strange in that you had to hold your room key against the pad for 3 seconds before you choose your floor.  There isn't a hotel parking ramp.  You can use valet ($42 per day with unlimited in and out) or you can park in the ramp across the street (~$16 per day).  \n\nGreat location on the Minneapolis skywalk.

The shower rocks and getting used to the shared closet and bathroom door took some time. The elevators were quick and the lobby shared with the breakfast area was nice.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They have a clean indoor pool, hot tub and sauna. I enjoyed a nice dinner at the restaurant. The location downtown allows you to walk to many local attractions. The only complaint I can come up with is the paid parking. You can park out on the street without paying but to be inside the gate it is paid parking.",4,positive

Getting there was easier than we expected (driving in large cities isnt our forte lol). Check in was easy and quick. I had reserved a king room but we were given a 2Q because they are refurbishing the king rooms. Slightly disappointed that we weren't notified ahead of time but overall not a big deal. \n    The room was clean and beds were comfortable. Loved the small things like the real glass barware in the rooms and a the menu guide for the tv. (Iknow its silly but not having one is frustrating). \n  We were there for an event at the Target Center and the time we were there the wind chill was -30 so the shuttle was a life-saver!! It is easly walkable and if the weather was nicer we definitely would've taken advantage of it and all the great shops, restaurants and activities of the area.\n  We will definitely be staying there again if we ever find ourselves downtown  Mpls again",5,positive

Gave great directions on how to get to parking entrance. Parking was only $10 a night, very cheap for downtown rates. Large lot. Easy in and out. Our room was very large. Layout was a touch awkward but still very nice. Bedroom separate from living space and bar\u002F kitchen area. Only issue was no luggage rack. Bed very comfortable but pillows were small and went flat after about 30 seconds of laying on them. Bedroom had 2 windows but for some reason only one window had blackout curtains so it was quite bright. Room was very quiet which was great. Water pressure was awesome in the shower. Osmosis water next to the ice machine was a nice perk. No issues with WiFi, worked great for us. TV was satellite so there was a decent amount of channels however it kept cutting out.

data/ca/43323/77006/661816936.html,Best Western Plus The Normandy Inn &amp; Suites,"""We scheduled our trip to Minneapolis for spring break to visit the city and friends there and to give our kids (ages 8 and 4) a chance to go swimming in a pool.  When we initially got there, we were put in a room right by the elevator with a view of another wall of the hotel.  They kindly moved us to a better room which had a view of the street and away from the elevator.  The room was fine and suited our needs for this trip, but the issues came up with the pool being closed for 2 and a half days straight during spring break.  The first pool closure (Sunday) was because someone dueced in the pool, so it had to be closed or 24 hours.  I get that you need to close it to clean it.  However, the hotel then put up a sign that the pool would be closed the whole day on Monday as well due to scheduled maintenance.  When I went to the front desk to ask about this, they said, \""Well, it must have been scheduled after you booked your room otherwise we would have told you.\""  Well, they could have told us when we checked in 2 days earlier so that we didn't unload our stuff and get settled in.  When we book a hotel room with our kids, we look at if it has two rooms and how the pool is so that the kids can use it.  This pool looked great and we were able to use it the first night, but having it shut down for most of our trip defeated the purpose of us staying there.  Our only compensation initially was \""Well, we won't charge you if you need to cancel your reservation and go to another hotel.\""  We had already unpacked and had plans...we're not going to waste our time doing that.  Finally on our last day (Tuesday), the pool still was not open in the morning, so the front desk offered a free breakfast and a late checkout.  By the time we finished breakfast the pool was opened up.  We had it to ourselves, but the chlorine levels were so high that we ruined two swim suits and we all got chemical burns from being the first ones in the pool.  Kids still had fun, but we would have liked to have more pool time.  In hindsight, I wish we had stayed at the Embassy Suites due to the pool issue and the location of that hotel.  We had to walk about a half hour to get to Pizza Luce the first night and on the way back our kids got some experience in being drug deals and ladies of the night.  There isn't much to eat in the vicinity of the hotel, so be ready to walk to get there.",2,negative

My husband said the corned beef hash was THE best he's ever had.   I'd suggest they offer dinner in the cafe as well.  Far nicer place to dine.  And leave the bar as a bar.\n\nWe were on a package that included room, parking, drinks, dinner coupons and breakfast coupon.

However, the dated facility presents challenges for modern travelers.  The bathroom is very tight with only a pedestal sink and narrow shelf above   This makes it difficult to use a hairdryer or place toiletries within reach.  The shower head was stuck in pulse mode and the sink drained slowly.  The Kleenex container is built into the wall but looks like it could fall out at any time but there is an old-fashioned bottle opener on the wall!  Because the desk is situated so closely to the air-conditioner, I went down to the 7th floor business center to work. My computer needed charging but the only outlet was back behind tables in a difficult to reach corner.  I would have gone to the lobby to find an outlet and work there but the hotel does not have a lobby or convenience center\u2014just a check-in desk with a large square leather bench.  There is a very small set of shelves with a few snacks and drinks opposite check-in.  There is a larger sundries store just outside the hotel foot that accesses the skyway.  However; it appears to close by 5 pm as do the surrounding snack shops.  Now, I have read responses from management to guest criticism on this site that state the hotel has been updated many times since it was built in the 60\u2019s.  The issues with the hotel go beyond putting in new carpet and bedding.  The rooms (especially bathrooms) need restructuring, housekeeping shouldn\u2019t have to use over-powering carpet freshener to make the room smell good (btw this stuff is a real irritant for those with allergies).  Wiring needs to be updated to provide essential outlets for technology.  Given the hotel\u2019s location, it should be a star choice in this competitive downtown hotel environment.  Owners should invest the funds to make the necessary updates instead of leaving management to make excuses for a rapidly declining hotel.",2,negative

I was happy to have found this place. To be honest, the traffic around downtown Minneapolis is poor. Worse yet, there is road work being done all over the place including right down the street to the nearby new football stadium. If there ever was an oasis, even in Minneapolis, it would be THIS place! After you park(in a nearby and expensive ramp, $17 overnight) I got the feeling of walking into a resort-like property: chrome and leather; clean-smelling rooms; steel and woods, comfy chairs and sofas and an over-the-top friendliness in a staff that you can only find in the midwest. Once I checked in, the room had that \""just vacuumed look and smell\"" and the bed was REALLY comfy! The bathroom was divine and the added touches of a mini-fridge, tv and free wifi was a blessing. I checked out the fitness area and made use of their free weights, treadmill and area to stretch. They offer a pool although I did not use it. It looked small.\nI needed to arrange a shuttle to the hospital and back and it was done so for free or at a reduced rate at this place. What a relief to let someone else do all the driving for a change! These people did one heck of a nice job!

This Courtyard stands out as a real jewel in their Marriott crown.  Everyone I dealt with was professional,  friendly and helpful.   \n\nStarting with Samantha, the banquet sales contact for me.  She was prompt, responsive and eager to ensure that her property delivered an above average experience.   \n\nOur AV needs were handled by Nick, who was truly on top of his game.   Each detail was attendee to promptly and handily.  \n\nHe even reached out to his associate at the next meeting hotel in Dallas to ensure that AV person knew our needs and physical setup.  \n\nOur food and beverage service was timely and well presented.  I have forgotten the young man's name but he was quietly efficient and the food was delicious.   \n\nThe sleeping rooms were large enough with what appeared to be new or newly renovated baths and furniture.  Lighting was sufficient but if you travel without a partner the bathroom can be a challenge for 2 at a time.  \n\nThe hotel is 14 floors high unlike the traditional Courtyard and the lobby is two stories high with a horse show shaped bar in the Bistro.  \n\nThe gym on the 14th floor offers sweeping views of the cityscape and if, like me, you work out early you enjoy the sunrise.  It houses plenty of Cardio equipment and free weights as well as a stationary machine.   Equipment is state of the art with cable TV on each machine.  \n\nOne note of importance is the hotel has no parking of their own.  There is a parking concession offering valet parking but they close at 10:00 pm.  So, if you go to dinner at 8:00 you wind up self parking if you return after 10:00 pm.  And the price is steep, IMHO, for a city like MSP.   $22.00 a day for valet or self park with in and out privileges.   \n\nThat said, this Courtyard is in a word elegant.  All the staff are friendly and helpful.  And to drive the point home about Samantha wanting us to have a great experience,  she relocated our meeting to a different room when I mentioned that it was a bit warm with 20 people on 20 laptops.  \n\nSo, overnight they moved the tables, chairs, and complete AV set up to a larger cooler room at no charge.   \n\nThat, gentle reader, is the definition of customer satisfaction.

Great if you want to buy Starbucks coffee in the mornings along with paying for your room.  I've never been in any other Courtyard that did not offer complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning.  Some may prefer the Starbucks; I did not.  Second, there is no official hotel parking and THEY DO NOT VALIDATE.  That's just plain stupid!  They should at least provide a discount on parking (which is $22 a day).

I immediately started getting angry, I had made a reservation--what good is a reservation if the hotel doesn't honor it?  The guy behind the counter said he would put me in a queen bed room for the night, then move me the next day to a king bed; in the meantime, he would comp. me breakfast the next day.  Free breakfast--I was planning on eating there the next morning, can't get angry about that.  I calmed down and accepted the offer.  I also requested a quiet room, away from the freeway noise.   I got to the room, bed was very comfortable.  I could see the freeway through the window, yet minimal noise from it.  I was happy with the room, to the point I didn't switch the next day.

data/ca/43323/90380/433416338.html,Courtyard by Marriott Minneapolis Downtown,"""What I loved about this hotel was the price. I compared other hotels for rates and also factored parking\u002Fwifi\u002Faccess to food, and this came out ahead of all the hotels in downtown Minneapolis. Our room was spacious, extremely clean, no dust, and sheets were crisp. This hotel has free wifi, which many hotels downtown charge for. The parking ramp is directly behind the hotel; literally come down the parking elevator and walk onto the front porch of the hotel. The hotel was right off the interstate, 5 minute drive to US Bank Stadium. The crime rates for the location, according to stats from the police website, especially for robbery\u002Fassault, were low compared to hotels further downtown.\nThe downsides are the parking is a ticket system. Anytime you leave the lot, you have to pay the ticket. So, we paid $17 per day, but we never left the ramp, and there are hourly rates as well. Another con is the only food in the hotel is the Starbucks\u002FBistro\u002FBar immediately to the right when you walk in. For a meal for two, it was $50. The Bistro does not deliver room service. If you want food, you can order by phone, but you have to walk all the way down to the lobby to get your food. They have a pantry where they charge $2.50-$3.50 per item, ie candy bar. To note, the hotel room does come with a coffeemaker as well.\nIn closing, the customer service was friendly, and when we did order food, it only took about 20 minutes for them to make it. I never checked out the fitness center nor pool. I would recommend this hotel, mainly because it simply the BEST deal for a downtown hotel, but they could do a lot to improve the functionality of their hotel for guests, such as hiring people to deliver room service, validating parking for hotel guests, offering free continental breakfast, opening an actual hotel restaurant. These are all things that every guest appreciates.",5,positive

The hotel itself is updated, clean and a typical Courtyard property high rise.  I had a couple of issues that I think readers need to be aware of:\n\n1) The hotel has a shuttle but it only goes to designated places.  The location needed to visit and to be picked up at was 1.8 miles away.  The shuttle service is contracted out to a third party.\n\n2) Taxi cabs are not readily available at this location as with other hotels in the downtown area.  They do have a town car that obviously charges more than a taxi to go to the airport or to your destination. \n\n3) Other reviewers have commented on the overall restaurant selection in West Bank.  It's a little disappointing.  If you are a walker like I am, you can walk up Washington and hit a new Trader Joes or take an extended walk through the Univ of MN campus and end up in Dinkytown.   However, I am not a fan of walking over highway overpasses that have homeless people loitering and camping out.\n\nMaybe it's the 7 corners that are associated with this neighborhood for the bad feng shui.  Unfortunately, I won't be back.",3,negative

The check-in line can be very crowded during peak hours, and they could use more stations for check-in during those times. It is worth a call to the desk to avoid their busy times for arrival or departure.\nThe restaurant in the lobby is deceptive. It looks like a lovely and limited bar, but the food at dinner is very well prepared and well served.  The mornings find a Starbucks-like coffee shop with limited but well prepared food.\nWe were on a top floor and one element which always amazed us was the availability at any hour of an elevator. They seem to have them programed to always offer prompt service.\nParking is connected to the hotel, but seems to be run by a separate company. It is not cheap, but seems to run efficiently, allowing one to come and go. At peak hours, finding a close parking spot can be frustrating, but there is always room.",5,positive

I was told they couldn't go to the theater, but could take me to a stop about three blocks away. I said great--I didn't mind that walk. However, this was not true. I had to go to this theater about six times over my stay. I would not have chosen this hotel if they had been honest about their shuttle service (or lack there of.)

During this time another customer called for the shuttle and was also told the driver \""just picked some people up in the same stop and would have to come back\"". No driver had come and no one had been picked up.

There was a couch next to the bed that could sleep additional guests.  It wasn\u2019t super spacious, but the true highlights of the hotel are in the shared spaces.  The restroom was compact and it\u2019s tricky to have more than one person to get ready at a time.  The only mirror found was in the bathroom, so the room could really benefit by providing an additional mirror near counter space in case multiple people are getting ready at one time.  The TV was a good size, and views were cool.

As a guest of the hotel you can also get in and out privileges for about $5 more, just bring your parking ramp ticket with you into the hotel for validation.  \n\nThe Staff:\nWe were able to check in so quickly it surprised me.  All staff we encountered seemed friendly, competent, and enabled to assist guests - they were quite pleasant.\n\nThe Location:\nThis hotel offers easy access to a number of highways.  It\u2019s near US Bank Stadium and is surrounded by a lot of great restaurants, bars, breweries, and nightlife.  On the Saturday night we visited there were a lot of options for live music - everything from reggae to hard rock.  The property advertises at Gopher games and is just across the river from the University area.  Cedar Cultural Center is an easy, roughly 6 block walk from the hotel.

Had all kinds of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, full size basketball court, raquetball court.  I was very impressed.  I stayed in a junior executive suite and it was very roomy.
